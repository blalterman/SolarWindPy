# Phase 3: Agent System Integration

## Phase Metadata
- **Phase**: 3/5
- **Estimated Duration**: 1.5 hours
- **Dependencies**: Phase 1 (Security Foundation), Phase 2 (Hook Integration)
- **Status**: Not Started

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase Objective
Integrate the 8-agent specialized system into .claude/settings.json to provide intelligent routing, context-aware suggestions, and domain expertise guidance that enhances development workflow efficiency and scientific accuracy.

## ðŸ§  Phase Context
SolarWindPy has developed 8 specialized agents (UnifiedPlanCoordinator, PhysicsValidator, DataFrameArchitect, NumericalStabilityGuard, PlottingEngineer, FitFunctionSpecialist, TestEngineer) that provide domain expertise and intelligent task routing. Currently, these agents are not integrated into the settings configuration, missing opportunities for automatic routing and intelligent suggestions based on user context and file changes.

- `instabilities/*.py` â†’ PhysicsValidator, NumericalStabilityGuard

**Keyword-Based Routing:**
- "plan", "implement", "coordinate" â†’ UnifiedPlanCoordinator
- "plot", "figure", "visualization" â†’ PlottingEngineer
- "test", "coverage", "quality" â†’ TestEngineer
- "fit", "curve", "regression" â†’ FitFunctionSpecialist
