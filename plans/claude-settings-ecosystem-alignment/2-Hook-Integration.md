# Phase 2: Hook Integration & Configuration

## Phase Metadata
- **Phase**: 2/5
- **Estimated Duration**: 1.5 hours
- **Dependencies**: Phase 1 (Security Foundation)
- **Status**: Completed
- **Implementation Commit**: 9a4d395
- **Actual Duration**: ~10-15 minutes

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase Objective
Integrate all 7 hooks into .claude/settings.json with proper configuration, argument utilization, and intelligent triggering to maximize the hook ecosystem's effectiveness while maintaining secure execution.

## ðŸ§  Phase Context
Currently only 5 of 7 hooks are configured in settings.json, and existing hooks don't fully utilize their rich argument capabilities. The missing hooks (test-runner.sh and coverage-monitor.py) provide critical functionality for smart test execution and coverage analysis. This phase integrates all hooks with proper triggers, arguments, and execution contexts.

- [x] coverage-monitor.py provides comprehensive coverage analysis
- [x] Hook arguments are fully utilized for contextual execution
- [x] Intelligent triggering reduces unnecessary hook executions
- [x] Physics validation automatically triggers for relevant changes
- [x] Workflow enforcement prevents common development mistakes
- [x] Hook performance is optimized with appropriate timeouts and limits
- [x] Error handling provides graceful degradation
- [x] Hook coordination prevents conflicts and duplicate work

## ðŸ§ª Phase Testing Strategy
- **Hook Integration Testing**: Verify each hook executes correctly with proper arguments
- **Trigger Logic Testing**: Validate context-aware triggering works as expected
- **Performance Testing**: Confirm hooks execute within timeout limits
- **Error Handling Testing**: Verify graceful degradation when hooks fail
- **Coordination Testing**: Ensure hooks work together without conflicts

## ðŸ”§ Phase Technical Requirements
- **Hook Script Analysis**: Understanding of each hook's capabilities and arguments
- **Trigger Pattern Design**: Intelligent pattern matching for contextual execution
- **Performance Monitoring**: Resource usage tracking and optimization
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Configuration Validation**: Ensure hook configurations are correct and maintainable

## ðŸ“‚ Phase Affected Areas
- `.claude/settings.json` - Primary hook configuration
- Hook trigger patterns and execution contexts
- Hook argument specifications and validations
- Performance and resource management settings

## ðŸ“Š Phase Progress Tracking

## ðŸ’¬ Phase Implementation Notes

### Hook Integration Strategy
**Missing Hooks to Integrate:**
1. **test-runner.sh**: Smart test execution with contextual selection
2. **coverage-monitor.py**: Comprehensive coverage analysis and reporting

**Enhanced Argument Utilization:**
- **test-runner.sh**: --changed, --physics, --coverage, --module, --timeout, --parallel
- **physics-validation.py**: --strict, --report, --fix, --scope
- **git-workflow-validator.sh**: --enforce-branch, --check-tests, --validate-message

### Intelligent Triggering Design
**Context-Aware Patterns:**
- **Code Changes**: Trigger appropriate tests based on modified files
- **Physics Changes**: Automatic validation for core/ and instabilities/ modifications
- **Test Changes**: Smart test execution for test file modifications
- **Git Operations**: Workflow enforcement for branch and commit operations

### Performance Considerations
- Hook execution should not significantly impact development workflow
- Parallel execution where possible to minimize delays
- Intelligent caching to avoid redundant operations
- Resource limits to prevent system impact

### Coordination Requirements
- Prevent duplicate test runs from multiple triggers
- Coordinate timing to avoid resource conflicts
- Share context between hooks where beneficial
- Maintain audit trail of hook execution decisions
