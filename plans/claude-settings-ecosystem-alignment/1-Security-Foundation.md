# Phase 1: Security Foundation & Permission Restructure

## Phase Metadata
- **Phase**: 1/5
- **Estimated Duration**: 2.0 hours
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Status**: Not Started

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase Objective
Implement comprehensive multi-layered security foundation with granular pattern-based permissions, replacing overly restrictive wildcards with precise controls that enable hook execution while maintaining rigorous security standards.

## ðŸ§  Phase Context
Current .claude/settings.json has overly restrictive permissions that block legitimate hook execution while using broad patterns that could potentially allow unintended access. This phase establishes a defense-in-depth security model with 6 distinct layers, each providing specific protection while enabling the sophisticated hook and agent ecosystem to function properly.

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Tasks

### Task Group 1: Permission Matrix Analysis & Design
- [ ] **Analyze current permission gaps** (Est: 20min) - Document all blocked operations and security vulnerabilities
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Focus on hook execution failures and overly broad patterns
- [ ] **Design granular permission patterns** (Est: 30min) - Create specific patterns for each hook and script
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Use file-specific patterns instead of wildcards where possible
- [ ] **Create security layer specifications** (Est: 20min) - Define the 6-layer security model implementation
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Each layer should have clear responsibility and validation criteria

### Task Group 2: Layer 1 - Granular Pattern-Based Permissions
- [ ] **Implement hook-specific Bash permissions** (Est: 15min) - Add precise patterns for each hook script
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Enable .claude/hooks/* execution with argument validation
- [ ] **Add script and utility permissions** (Est: 10min) - Include generate-test.py and other utilities
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Maintain existing tool permissions with refinements
- [ ] **Enhance file operation security** (Est: 15min) - Granular Read/Edit permissions for configuration files
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Protect sensitive files while enabling legitimate operations

### Task Group 3: Layer 2 - Enhanced Deny Lists & Input Validation
- [ ] **Expand comprehensive deny patterns** (Est: 10min) - Add protection for additional sensitive file types
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Include API keys, certificates, private keys, database credentials
- [ ] **Implement argument validation patterns** (Est: 15min) - Add validation for hook and script arguments
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Prevent injection attacks through argument validation
- [ ] **Add execution environment restrictions** (Est: 10min) - Define resource limits and timeout controls
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Prevent resource exhaustion and runaway processes

### Task Group 4: Layer 3 & 4 - Execution Controls & Audit Framework
- [ ] **Implement execution timeout controls** (Est: 15min) - Add timeout specifications for different operation types
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Different timeouts for hooks, tests, and utilities
- [ ] **Design audit logging framework** (Est: 15min) - Create comprehensive logging specification
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Log all permission checks, denials, and hook executions
- [ ] **Add security monitoring triggers** (Est: 10min) - Define monitoring points and alert conditions
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Monitor for suspicious patterns and repeated failures

## âœ… Phase Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 7 hooks have appropriate execution permissions with granular patterns
- [ ] Enhanced deny list covers all sensitive file types and patterns
- [ ] Input validation prevents injection attacks through arguments
- [ ] Execution controls prevent resource exhaustion
- [ ] Audit logging framework captures all security-relevant events
- [ ] Security monitoring identifies and alerts on suspicious activities
- [ ] No legitimate operations are blocked by new permission structure
- [ ] All security layers are independently testable and maintainable

## ðŸ§ª Phase Testing Strategy
- **Permission Boundary Testing**: Test edge cases for each permission pattern
- **Injection Attack Prevention**: Validate argument sanitization and validation
- **Resource Limit Testing**: Verify timeout and resource controls function correctly
- **Audit Trail Verification**: Ensure all operations are properly logged
- **False Positive Testing**: Confirm legitimate operations are not blocked

## ðŸ”§ Phase Technical Requirements
- **Configuration Format**: JSON with nested security specifications
- **Validation Framework**: Pattern matching with regular expressions
- **Logging Integration**: Compatible with existing SolarWindPy logging
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal overhead for permission checking
- **Maintainability**: Clear, documented security policies

## ðŸ“‚ Phase Affected Areas
- `.claude/settings.json` - Primary security configuration
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - User-specific security overrides
- Security documentation and implementation notes

## ðŸ“Š Phase Progress Tracking

### Current Status
- **Tasks Completed**: 0/12
- **Time Invested**: 0h of 2.0h
- **Completion Percentage**: 0%
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-16

### Blockers & Issues
- None identified at planning stage
- Potential complexity in permission pattern testing
- Need to validate no legitimate operations are blocked

### Next Actions
- Begin permission matrix analysis
- Document current security gaps
- Design comprehensive layer specifications

## ðŸ’¬ Phase Implementation Notes

### Security Philosophy
This phase implements defense-in-depth with these principles:
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Deny by default, allow explicitly
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple independent security layers
- **Auditability**: Comprehensive logging of all security decisions

### Multi-Layer Security Model
1. **Layer 1**: Granular pattern-based permissions
2. **Layer 2**: Input validation and argument sanitization  
3. **Layer 3**: Execution environment restrictions
4. **Layer 4**: Audit logging and monitoring
5. **Layer 5**: Enhanced deny list enforcement
6. **Layer 6**: Security monitoring and alerting

### Implementation Considerations
- Balance security with usability for development workflow
- Ensure patterns are maintainable and understandable
- Provide clear error messages for denied operations
- Enable easy updates for new hooks and tools
