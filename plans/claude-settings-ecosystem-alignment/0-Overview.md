## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Align .claude/settings.json with the comprehensive hook, agent, and tool ecosystem to create a secure, efficient, and intelligent development environment that maximizes productivity while maintaining rigorous security controls and scientific validation standards.

## ðŸ§  Context
SolarWindPy has evolved a sophisticated development ecosystem with 7 specialized hooks, 8 domain-specific agents, and comprehensive automation tools. However, the current .claude/settings.json configuration has critical gaps:

**Current Assets:**
- 7 hooks: validate-session-state.sh, git-workflow-validator.sh, test-runner.sh, physics-validation.py, coverage-monitor.py, create-compaction.py, pre-commit-tests.sh
- 1 script: generate-test.py
- 8 agents: UnifiedPlanCoordinator, PhysicsValidator, DataFrameArchitect, NumericalStabilityGuard, PlottingEngineer, FitFunctionSpecialist, TestEngineer

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **Permission Misalignments**: Overly restrictive permissions blocking hook execution
2. **Missing Hook Integrations**: Only 5/7 hooks configured in settings.json
3. **Agent System Disconnected**: No guidance on specialized agent usage
4. **Hook Argument Underutilization**: Rich hook options not exposed in configuration

## ðŸ”§ Technical Requirements
- **Security**: Multi-layered security with granular permissions, input validation, execution restrictions
- **Performance**: Smart hook execution with resource limits and timeout controls
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive audit logging and security alerting
- **Usability**: Context-aware suggestions and intelligent workflow routing
- **Maintenance**: Clear rollback procedures and success metrics

## ðŸ“‚ Affected Areas
- .claude/settings.json (primary configuration)
- .claude/settings.local.json (user-specific overrides)
- Hook integration patterns
- Agent routing configurations
- Security permission matrices
- Workflow automation triggers

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 7 hooks properly integrated with appropriate permissions
- [ ] Multi-layered security implementation with granular controls
- [ ] Agent system guidance integrated for intelligent routing
- [ ] Hook arguments fully utilized for enhanced functionality
- [ ] Comprehensive audit logging and monitoring established
- [ ] All security controls tested and validated
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented and tested
- [ ] Performance metrics baseline established

## ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy
**Security Testing:**
- Permission boundary testing
- Input validation verification
- Execution environment isolation testing
- Audit log integrity verification

**Functional Testing:**
- Hook execution testing with various scenarios
- Agent routing validation
- Workflow automation testing
- Performance impact assessment

**Integration Testing:**
- End-to-end development workflow testing
- Cross-hook interaction validation
- Agent handoff testing
- Error handling and recovery testing

## ðŸ“Š Progress Tracking

### Overall Status
- **Phases Completed**: 0/5
- **Tasks Completed**: 0/47
- **Time Invested**: 0h of 6-8h
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-16

### Implementation Notes
- Plan created with comprehensive multi-layered security approach
- Focus on practical implementation while maintaining rigorous security
- Emphasis on immediate usability improvements with full ecosystem integration

## ðŸ”— Related Plans
