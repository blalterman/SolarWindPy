# Compaction Agent System - Overview

## Plan Metadata
- **Plan Name**: Compaction Agent System Architecture
- **Created**: 2025-08-11
- **Branch**: plan/compaction-agent-system
- **Implementation Branch**: feature/compaction-agent-system
- **PlanManager**: PlanManager
- **PlanImplementer**: PlanImplementer
- **Structure**: Multi-Phase
- **Total Phases**: 5
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Affects**: .claude/agents/, solarwindpy/plans/*/compacted_state.md, all planning agents
- **Estimated Duration**: 4 hours
- **Status**: In Progress

## Phase Overview
- [ ] **Phase 1: Universal Compaction Agent Development** (Est: 90 min) - Create core compaction agent with tiered processing
- [ ] **Phase 2: Agent Integration Updates** (Est: 60 min) - Update all 6 planning/implementation agents
- [ ] **Phase 3: File Structure & Git Integration** (Est: 45 min) - Plan-specific directories and git workflows
- [ ] **Phase 4: Compacted State Template** (Est: 30 min) - Structured template system
- [ ] **Phase 5: Testing & Validation** (Est: 45 min) - Comprehensive testing across agent tiers

## Phase Files
1. [implementation-plan.md](./implementation-plan.md) (Phase 1-5 combined)
2. [agents-index-update-plan.md](./agents-index-update-plan.md)
3. [compacted_state.md](./compacted_state.md) (template)
4. [system-validation-report.md](./system-validation-report.md)
5. [usage-guide.md](./usage-guide.md)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Develop a centralized CompactionAgent to eliminate 8,000+ tokens of duplicated context management logic across 6 planning agents, creating a single source of truth for session continuity while reducing token usage by 2,400-4,200 tokens across the ecosystem with plan-specific compaction state management.

## ðŸ§  Context
The repository's planning agents contain context management and session continuity logic that can be centralized. A CompactionAgent provides tiered compression services while maintaining agent specialization.

### Current Token Distribution Analysis
```
PlanManager (~1,200 tokens): Core planning with velocity tracking
PlanImplementer (~1,200 tokens): Core implementation with git integration

CompactionAgent provides centralized compression services for both agents
while maintaining their specialized functionality.
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Requirements
- **Agent Architecture**: Universal CompactionAgent supporting all 6 planning agent variants
- **Compression Targets**: 40-70% token reduction depending on agent complexity
- **Git Integration**: Automated commits and tagging for compaction events
- **File Management**: Plan-specific compacted_state.md files for multi-developer safety
- **Template System**: Structured compaction state format
- **Quality Preservation**: Maintain development continuity across sessions

## ðŸ“‚ Affected Areas
- `.claude/agents/agent-compaction.md` - New universal compaction agent
- `.claude/agents/agent-plan-manager*.md` - All 6 planning agents (integration updates)
- `solarwindpy/plans/*/compacted_state.md` - Plan-specific compaction states
- Git workflow integration - Commit patterns and tagging system

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CompactionAgent implemented with tiered processing for all 6 agent variants
- [ ] Token reduction achieved: 2,400-4,200 tokens saved across ecosystem (30-50% per agent)
- [ ] All 6 planning agents successfully integrated with <50 tokens compaction logic each
- [ ] Plan-specific directory structure prevents multi-developer conflicts
- [ ] Git integration working with meaningful commits and tags
- [ ] Compacted state template system operational
- [ ] Session resumption quality maintained after compression
- [ ] Comprehensive testing validates all agent tier combinations

## ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy
- **Integration Testing**: Validate all planning agents work with CompactionAgent
- **Compression Testing**: Measure actual token reduction achieved across tiers
- **Git Integration Testing**: Verify commit and tag workflows
- **Multi-Developer Testing**: Test parallel plan compaction scenarios
- **Session Continuity Testing**: Validate resumption quality after compression
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure compaction operations complete efficiently

## ðŸ“Š Progress Tracking

### Overall Status
- **Phases Completed**: 0/5
- **Tasks Completed**: 0/TBD
- **Time Invested**: 0h of 4h
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-12

### Expected Token Savings
```
CompactionAgent: ~800 tokens (comprehensive operations)
Per-Agent Integration: ~50 tokens each (6 agents = 300 tokens)
TOTAL POST-CONSOLIDATION: ~1,100 tokens
NET SAVINGS: ~6,900 tokens (86% reduction in context logic)
```

## ðŸ”— Related Plans
- Single Ecosystem Plan Implementation (completed) - Established plan structure standards
- Session Continuity Protocol - Context management principles
- Git Integration Agent - Git workflow automation patterns

## ðŸ’¬ Notes & Considerations

### Architecture Benefits
- **Single Source of Truth**: All context management centralized and consistent
- **Reduced Maintenance**: Changes made once, applied everywhere
- **Enhanced Features**: Advanced compaction operations available to all agents
- **Quality Improvement**: Centralized testing ensures higher reliability

### Design Principles
- **Service-Oriented**: CompactionAgent as service, not inheritance
- **Tiered Processing**: Match compression complexity to agent sophistication
- **Multi-Developer Safety**: Plan-specific files prevent conflicts
- **Git-First Integration**: Meaningful version control for compaction events

### Risk Mitigation
- **Phased Implementation**: Systematic rollout with validation at each step
- **Rollback Strategy**: Original agent files preserved until complete validation
- **Quality Monitoring**: Session resumption quality metrics tracked
- **Token Efficiency**: Actual savings measured against projections
