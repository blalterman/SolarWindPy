### Implementation Notes
*Plan abandoned 2025-08-19 - see Abandonment Rationale section below.*

## ðŸš« Abandonment Rationale

This plan was abandoned on 2025-08-19 for the following reasons:

### Over-Engineering vs Pragmatic Solutions
- **Scale mismatch**: 20-30 hour investment for marginal improvements over existing working system
- **Complexity risk**: 85 tasks across 5 phases introduces significant risk for limited benefit
- **Working system exists**: Current 8-hook ecosystem already provides comprehensive coverage

### SolarWindPy Philosophy Conflict
- **Pragmatic approach preferred**: Recent compaction-hook-enhancement delivered more value in 2 hours than this 30-hour plan would
- **Scientific focus**: SolarWindPy prioritizes reliable scientific computing over complex development infrastructure
- **Risk aversion**: Affects core systems (`.claude/hooks/`, `tests/`, `solarwindpy/core/`) with unclear ROI

### Historical Pattern Recognition
- **compaction-agent-system**: Previously abandoned as "architecturally misaligned approach"
- **compaction-hook-enhancement**: Succeeded with pragmatic 2-hour enhancement vs complex architecture
- **Current hook system**: Already provides all identified needs:
  - âœ… Coverage monitoring (`coverage-monitor.py`)
  - âœ… Intelligent compaction (`create-compaction.py` - recently enhanced)
  - âœ… Git workflow validation (`git-workflow-validator.sh`)
  - âœ… Physics validation (`physics-validation.py`)
  - âœ… Plan completion automation (`plan-completion-manager.py`)
  - âœ… Test execution (`pre-commit-tests.sh`, `test-runner.sh`)
  - âœ… Session state management (`validate-session-state.sh`)

### Alternative Approach
Instead of comprehensive overhaul, SolarWindPy's proven approach is:
- **Incremental enhancement**: Small, focused improvements to existing working systems
- **Evidence-based development**: Only implement features that solve actual demonstrated problems
- **Low-risk evolution**: Enhance what works rather than replace with complex architectures

### Final Assessment
The existing hook system with recent enhancements provides all necessary functionality for SolarWindPy's scientific development workflow. This comprehensive overhaul plan represents over-engineering that conflicts with the project's pragmatic, risk-averse philosophy.

## ðŸ’¬ Notes & Considerations

### Scientific Computing Considerations
- **Reproducibility**: All validation must support reproducible research
