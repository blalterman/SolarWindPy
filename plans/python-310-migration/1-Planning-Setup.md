# Phase 1: Planning & Setup

**Duration**: 2 hours  
**Status**: Completed  
**Branch**: plan/python-310-migration

## 🎯 Phase Objectives
- Initialize plan directory with comprehensive documentation
- Generate value propositions via automated hooks  
- Document migration scope and rationale
- Set up velocity tracking for future planning improvements

## 📋 Tasks

### Task 1.1: Plan Infrastructure Setup (30 minutes)
**Deliverable**: Complete plan directory structure

#### Steps:
1. ✅ Create plan branch: `plan/python-310-migration`
2. ✅ Create plan directory: `plans/python-310-migration/`
3. ✅ Initialize 0-Overview.md with scope audit
4. Create remaining phase documents (1-5)

#### Success Criteria:
- [x] Plan branch created and checked out
- [x] All phase documents created with proper structure
- [x] Overview includes integrated scope audit
- [x] No version tagging references (removed as requested)

### Task 1.2: Value Proposition Generation (45 minutes)
**Deliverable**: Complete value propositions for all 7 required sections

#### Steps:
1. Run value proposition generator hook:
   ```bash
   python .claude/hooks/plan-value-generator.py \
     --plan-file plans/python-310-migration/0-Overview.md \
     --exclude-fair
   ```
2. Verify all 7 sections are populated:
   - 📊 Value Proposition Analysis
   - 💰 Resource & Cost Analysis
   - ⚠️ Risk Assessment & Mitigation
   - 🔒 Security Proposition
   - 💾 Token Usage Optimization
   - ⏱️ Time Investment Analysis
   - 🎯 Usage & Adoption Metrics

#### Success Criteria:
- [x] All value proposition sections auto-generated
- [x] Scope audit integrated into propositions
- [x] FAIR compliance explicitly excluded
- [x] Pre-1.0 considerations documented
- [x] Phase 1 changes committed to git

### Task 1.3: Migration Rationale Documentation (30 minutes)
**Deliverable**: Clear justification for Python 3.10+ migration

#### Rationale Summary:
- **Dependency Reality**: NumPy 2.x and Astropy 7.x already require Python 3.10+
- **CI Waste**: Python 3.8/3.9 tests failing and consuming 40% of CI resources
- **Security**: Python 3.8 reaches EOL October 2024
- **Pre-1.0 Status**: Breaking changes acceptable in development releases
- **Resource Efficiency**: Immediate 40% CI cost reduction

#### Success Criteria:
- [x] Technical justification documented
- [x] Business case clearly stated
- [x] Scope appropriateness explained
- [x] Risk mitigation strategies defined

### Task 1.4: Velocity Tracking Setup (15 minutes)
**Deliverable**: Baseline metrics for future planning improvements

#### Velocity Baseline:
- **Plan Type**: Python version migration
- **Estimated Duration**: 20 hours
- **Complexity Factors**: 
  - CI matrix changes: 0.8x (simpler than expected)
  - Compatibility removal: 1.0x (standard)
  - Pre-1.0 scope: 0.7x (reduced complexity)

#### Success Criteria:
- [x] Baseline metrics recorded
- [x] Complexity factors identified
- [x] Future estimation inputs prepared

## 🔗 Dependencies
- None (initial phase)

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Complete plan directory structure created
- [x] All 7 value proposition sections generated
- [x] Scope audit integrated into overview
- [x] Migration rationale clearly documented
- [x] Version tagging references removed
- [x] Velocity baseline established

## 📊 Phase Outputs
1. **0-Overview.md** - Complete with scope audit and value propositions
2. **1-5 Phase documents** - Structured templates ready for population
3. **Migration rationale** - Clear justification documented
4. **Velocity baseline** - Metrics for future planning

## 📝 Git Commit for Phase 1
After completing all Phase 1 tasks:
```bash
git add plans/python-310-migration/
git commit -m "plan: complete Phase 1 - Planning & Setup

- Generated comprehensive value propositions via hooks
- Integrated scope audit into overview documentation
- Created multi-phase implementation structure
- Established velocity baseline for future planning
- Ready for Phase 2: Implementation"
```

## 🔄 Compaction Point
After Phase 1 completion:
```bash
python .claude/hooks/create-compaction.py --compression medium --plan python-310-migration
```

**User Action Required**: Please manually compact the context using `/compact` after Phase 1 completes to preserve session state and reduce token usage before proceeding to Phase 2.

## 🔄 Next Phase
Upon completion, proceed to **Phase 2: Implementation** with feature branch creation and core technical changes.

## 🧪 Validation
- [ ] Plan structure follows SolarWindPy templates
- [ ] All value propositions align with scope audit
- [ ] No version tagging or release pressure
- [ ] Appropriate for pre-1.0 development software

## 📝 Notes
- This phase focuses on preparation and documentation
- No code changes or git operations beyond plan creation  
- Emphasis on right-sizing scope for pre-1.0 software
- Integration of scope audit into value propositions

## ✅ Phase 1 Completion Summary

**Completed**: 2025-08-24
