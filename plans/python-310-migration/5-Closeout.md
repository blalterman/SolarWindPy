- **Code Quality**: [All checks passed | Issues noted below]
- **Performance Impact**: Expected 5-15% improvement from Python 3.10+ optimizations

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture Decisions

### Core Design Choices
- **Architectural Pattern**: Clean migration approach - remove old, don't add layers
- **Framework/Library Choices**: Alignment with NumPy 2.x, Astropy 7.x requirements
- **Data Structure Decisions**: No changes to MultiIndex DataFrame patterns - maintained compatibility

### Physics/Scientific Validation Patterns
- **Unit Consistency**: Maintained via existing physics validation hooks
- **Numerical Stability**: No changes to scientific calculations - purely Python version migration
- **Scientific Constraints**: All physics laws and principles unchanged
- **Validation Methods**: physics-validation.py hook confirmed no scientific code modifications

### Integration Decisions
- **SolarWindPy Ecosystem**: No changes to core/, plotting/, fitfunctions/ - only Python compatibility
- **API Design**: No public interface changes - purely internal compatibility cleanup
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Breaking change for Python < 3.10, but dependencies already required this
