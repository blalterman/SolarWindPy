- [ ] All environment files consistent

### Task 4.2: Simple Release Notes (30 minutes)
**Deliverable**: Clear but minimal release documentation

#### Release Notes Content:
```markdown
# Python 3.10+ Migration

## Summary
SolarWindPy now requires Python 3.10 or later.

## Background
- Dependencies (NumPy 2.x, Astropy 7.x) already require Python 3.10+
- Python 3.8 reaches end-of-life October 2024
- Reduces CI overhead by 40%

## Changes
- Updated `requires-python` to `>=3.10,<4`
- Removed Python 3.8/3.9 from CI matrix
- Removed compatibility code for older Python versions
- Modernized type hints where applicable

## Migration
For users on Python 3.8/3.9:
1. Update Python to 3.10 or later
2. Update dependencies: `pip install -U solarwindpy`

## Benefits
- 40% CI efficiency improvement
- Cleaner codebase without compatibility layers
- Access to Python 3.10+ performance improvements
- Alignment with scientific Python ecosystem
```

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Clear summary of changes
- [ ] Simple migration instructions
- [ ] Benefits articulated
- [ ] No extensive documentation overhead

### Task 4.3: Branch Merge Strategy (15 minutes)
**Deliverable**: Clean merge from feature to plan branch

#### Merge Process:
```bash
# Ensure we're on plan branch
git checkout plan/python-310-migration

# Merge feature branch
git merge feature/python-310-migration

# Verify merge is clean
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Clean merge without conflicts
- [ ] All implementation commits preserved
- [ ] Documentation updates included
- [ ] Plan branch ready for PR

### Task 4.4: Pull Request Creation (30 minutes)
**Deliverable**: Professional PR ready for review and merge

#### PR Content:
```bash
gh pr create --base master --head plan/python-310-migration \
  --title "feat: Python 3.10+ minimum support" \
  --body "## Summary
This PR migrates SolarWindPy to require Python 3.10 or later.

## Background
- Dependencies (NumPy 2.x, Astropy 7.x) already require Python 3.10+

- ✅ Reduced CI matrix from 15 to 9 jobs (40% reduction)
- ✅ Removed compatibility code for Python < 3.10
- ✅ Modernized type hints to Python 3.10+ syntax
- ✅ Updated documentation and environment files

## Testing
- ✅ All tests pass on Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- ✅ Coverage maintained at 94.25%+
- ✅ Physics validation confirmed
- ✅ No functionality regressions

## Benefits
- 40% CI resource reduction
- Cleaner codebase
- Modern Python features
- Alignment with dependencies

Breaking change: Python 3.8 and 3.9 no longer supported"
```

   git checkout master
   git pull origin master
   git log --oneline -5  # Verify merge commit
   ```

2. **Cleanup Branches** (optional):
   ```bash
   git branch -d plan/python-310-migration  # Local cleanup
   # Keep remote branches for history
   ```

3. **Verification**:
   ```bash
   # Quick verification
   python -c "import solarwindpy; print('✅ Import successful')"
   grep "requires-python" pyproject.toml  # Verify requirement
   ```

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Changes successfully merged to master
- [ ] Master branch functional
- [ ] Python 3.10+ requirement active
- [ ] No immediate issues

## 📝 Git Commit for Documentation

### Documentation Commit (before PR):
