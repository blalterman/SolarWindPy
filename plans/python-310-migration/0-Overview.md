## üéØ Objective
Migrate SolarWindPy to Python 3.10+ minimum support, aligning with dependency requirements and reducing CI overhead by 40%.

## üß† Context
- Dependencies (NumPy 2.x, Astropy 7.x) already require Python 3.10+
- Python 3.8/3.9 CI tests are failing and wasting resources
- Python 3.8 reaches EOL October 2024
- Pre-1.0 software can make breaking changes

## üìê Scope Audit & Appropriateness

### Why This Scope is Right for SolarWindPy

#### ‚úÖ Appropriate Elements (Keeping)
- **Core Changes**: Update pyproject.toml, CI matrix, remove compatibility code (8 hours)
- **Testing**: Verify on Python 3.10+ with existing test suite (8 hours)
- **Basic Documentation**: Update README.rst and release notes (2 hours)
- **Standard Merge**: Merge to master without version tagging (2 hours)

#### ‚ùå Over-Engineering Removed
- **No Legacy Branch**: Pre-1.0 software doesn't need maintenance branches
- **No Version Tagging**: Not ready for release versioning
- **No Migration Guide**: Simple version bump doesn't need extensive docs
- **No Communication Campaign**: Research community just needs clear requirements
- **No Extended Support**: Dependencies already broken on old Python

#### üìä Scope Comparison
| Aspect | Enterprise Approach | SolarWindPy Approach | Justification |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Time | 48 hours | 20 hours | Pre-1.0 allows simpler process |
| Legacy Support | 6-month branch | None | Breaking changes acceptable |
| Versioning | Immediate release | Merge without tag | Not ready for versioning |
| Documentation | Migration guide | README update | Simple version requirement |
| Communication | Multi-channel | Commit messages | Small development team |

### Pre-1.0 Considerations

- **User Expectations**: Research software users expect some instability
- **Dependency Reality**: Already broken on Python 3.8/3.9
- **Resource Efficiency**: 40% CI savings justifies clean break
