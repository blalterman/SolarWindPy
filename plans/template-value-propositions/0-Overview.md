## 🎯 Objective
Create an enhanced plan template system with comprehensive value propositions to improve planning decisions and optimize token usage. Focus on practical, immediately implementable assessments without requiring changes to SolarWindPy's core data structures.

Current plan templates lack systematic value assessment, leading to:
- Plans without clear justification for resource allocation
- Missing security risk assessments 
- Inefficient token usage during planning sessions
- Inconsistent plan quality across coordinators
- No systematic evaluation of development ROI

This enhancement adds structured value proposition sections with automated generation to address these gaps while maintaining SolarWindPy's development velocity.

## 🔧 Technical Requirements
- Python 3.11+ (SolarWindPy environment)
- Git integration for template management
- Hook system integration (.claude/hooks/)
