## 🎯 Objective
Establish a complete deployment pipeline for SolarWindPy that enforces semantic versioning and automates PyPI publishing. The pipeline must gracefully handle the 10-day PyPI token delay while maintaining all other deployment capabilities. This plan focuses on PyPI deployment and release automation, with ReadTheDocs integration completed separately in the readthedocs-simplified plan.

## 🧠 Context
SolarWindPy is a scientific Python package requiring:
- **Strict semantic versioning** for scientific reproducibility
- **Automated PyPI publishing** for package distribution
- **Release validation** to prevent breaking changes
- **Graceful degradation** during token unavailability periods

The existing publish.yml workflow has basic functionality but needs enhancement for production-ready deployment with proper validation gates and error handling. The setuptools_scm configuration is already present in pyproject.toml with tag regex filtering to separate release tags from compaction tags.

## 🔧 Technical Requirements
- **Python**: 3.8+ (current), 3.12 (latest for workflows)
- **setuptools_scm**: Version detection and validation (CONFIGURED in pyproject.toml with tag regex filtering)
- **GitHub Actions**: Unlimited resources for public repository
- **PyPI/TestPyPI**: Publishing targets (tokens available after 10 days)
- **Semantic Versioning**: Strict v{major}.{minor}.{patch}[-prerelease] format
- **Git Tag Management**: Separation of release tags (v*) from operational tags (claude/compaction/*)

## 📂 Affected Areas
- `.github/workflows/publish.yml` - Enhanced PyPI publishing workflow
- `.github/workflows/semver-check.yml` - New semantic version validation
- `scripts/` - New helper scripts for release management
- `README.rst` - Updated badges and installation instructions
- `CHANGELOG.md` - New changelog following Keep a Changelog format
- `.gitignore` - Version file exclusions (if needed)
- `pyproject.toml` - Refinements to existing setuptools_scm configuration

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All phases completed successfully with commit tracking
- [x] Semantic versioning strictly enforced via setuptools_scm
- [x] GitHub releases created automatically for all tags
- [x] PyPI publishing works (tested with graceful failure during token delay)
- [x] Version validation prevents invalid tags
- [x] Release readiness checker validates pre-release state
- [x] Rollback procedures documented and tested
- [x] All workflows tested with v0.1.0-rc1 release candidate
- [x] Code coverage maintained ≥ 95%

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
Comprehensive validation approach across all deployment components:

### Phase-by-Phase Validation
1. **Version Detection**: setuptools_scm can determine version from git state
2. **Tag Validation**: Semantic version enforcement rejects invalid formats
3. **Workflow Testing**: GitHub Actions execute successfully with expected behaviors
4. **Release Creation**: GitHub releases include proper artifacts and metadata

### Integration Testing
- **v0.1.0-rc1 Release**: Complete end-to-end test with real tag
- **PyPI Graceful Failure**: Verify informative error messages when tokens unavailable
- **Badge Validation**: All status badges reflect accurate repository state

### Risk Mitigation Testing
- **Invalid Tag Handling**: Workflow properly rejects malformed version tags
- **Token Rotation**: Deployment continues when new tokens are available
- **Network Issues**: Retries and fallbacks for external service dependencies

## 📊 Progress Tracking

## 💬 Notes & Considerations

### Critical Constraints
- **10-Day PyPI Token Delay**: All PyPI functionality must gracefully degrade with clear messaging
- **No Direct Master Commits**: All changes must go through feature branch workflow
- **Scientific Package Requirements**: Version immutability critical for reproducible research
- **Public Repository**: Unlimited GitHub Actions resources available
- **Existing Infrastructure**: setuptools_scm already configured with tag filtering - build on existing foundation
- **Tag Separation**: Release tags (v*) must be separate from operational tags (claude/compaction/*)

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Invalid semantic versions could break dependency resolution
- **Medium Risk**: Tag conflicts between release and compaction tags could confuse setuptools_scm
- **Low Risk**: PyPI token delay is temporary and well-understood
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive validation gates and tag regex filtering prevent deployment of broken configurations

### Success Metrics
- **Immediate Success** (without PyPI tokens): Version validation, GitHub releases
- **Full Success** (with PyPI tokens): Complete automated publishing pipeline
- **Long-term Success**: Zero manual intervention required for standard releases
