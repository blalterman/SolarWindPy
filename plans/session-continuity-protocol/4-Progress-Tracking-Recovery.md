## Git-Integrated Progress Tracking

### Session State Synchronization Protocol

**After Each Major Milestone:**
1. **Git Commit Evidence**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "milestone: complete [specific work] 
   
   [Description of completion]
   
   Generated with Claude Code
   
   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   ```

2. **Session State Update**
   - Reference specific git commit hashes as evidence
   - Update completion percentages based on git evidence
   - Remove outdated "remaining tasks" that are now committed

3. **Cross-Validation**
   ```bash
   # Verify session state claims match git reality
   git log --grep="[claimed-work]" --stat
   git diff [previous-commit] HEAD --name-only
   ```

### Automated Validation Triggers

**After Every 3 Commits:**
- Cross-check session state against git history
- Identify and correct any discrepancies
- Update completion percentages based on actual progress

**Before Starting New Major Work:**
- Run full pre-session validation checklist
- Resolve any session state inaccuracies
- Confirm priority alignment with development framework

## Error Recovery Procedures

### Session State Corruption Recovery
1. **Identify Corruption Indicators**
   - Session state claims contradicted by git evidence
   - Impossible completion percentages or timelines
   - Missing or incorrect file modification references

2. **Recovery Process**
   - Discard corrupted session state content
   - Reconstruct accurate state from git commit history
   - Cross-validate reconstruction with actual file states
   - Document recovery process for future reference

### Development Context Loss Recovery
1. **Assess Context Loss Scope**
   - Determine what development context was lost
   - Identify impact on current and planned work
   - Evaluate recovery effort required

2. **Context Reconstruction**
   - Use git history to reconstruct development timeline
   - Review recent commits and branch history for clues
   - Re-establish specialist agent coordination as needed
   - Resume development with reconstructed context

## Success Metrics

### Session Continuity Quality Indicators
- **Context Accuracy:** Session state matches git evidence 100% of time
- **Development Velocity:** Maintained or improved development speed
- **Work Completion:** High-completion work (85%+) finished before new work starts
- **Infrastructure Priority:** Critical infrastructure addressed before feature work

### Productivity Optimization Metrics  
- **Session Extension:** 2-3x longer productive sessions via compaction
- **Context Switching:** Minimized unproductive context switches
- **Work Completion Rate:** Improved completion rate for started initiatives
- **Quality Maintenance:** Maintained code quality and testing standards

## Implementation Impact
This protocol ensures sustained, focused development while maintaining the high-quality standards expected in scientific computing environments. By validating session state against git reality and prioritizing infrastructure work, it prevents the productivity losses associated with context switching and incomplete work.
