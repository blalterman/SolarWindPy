## Context Switching Prevention Framework

### Decision Matrix for New Work Requests

```
Is there Critical Infrastructure work pending?
├── YES → Complete infrastructure first (Priority 1)
└── NO ↓

Is there Active Plan work at 85%+ completion?
├── YES → Complete active plan first (Priority 2)  
└── NO ↓

Is requested work aligned with current development context?
├── YES → Proceed with new work (Priority 3/4)
└── NO → Use compaction system to preserve current context, then proceed
```

### Context Preservation Before Switching

When context switching is unavoidable:

1. **Document Current State** (10 min)
   - Update session state with accurate completion percentage
   - Reference specific git commits proving completion status
   - Document exact remaining tasks with time estimates

2. **Use Compaction System** (5 min)
   - Invoke appropriate planning/implementation agent pairing
   - Trigger compaction to preserve current context
   - Verify compacted state creation and git commit

3. **Create Resumption Plan** (5 min)
   - Document resumption priorities and next immediate tasks
   - Identify required specialist agents for continuation
   - Set timeline expectations for returning to preserved work

## Session Continuity Optimization

### Extended Session Management

**Token Budget Awareness:**
- Monitor token usage and plan compaction triggers
- Use appropriate agent pairings for optimal efficiency
- Leverage compaction system for 2-3x session extension

**Quality Maintenance During Extended Sessions:**
- Maintain testing standards throughout extended sessions
- Preserve specialist agent coordination across compressions
- Ensure physics validation and numerical stability checks

**Compaction Timing Strategy:**
- Trigger compaction at phase boundaries for optimal context preservation
- Use manual compaction before complex multi-phase work
- Preserve specialist integration points during compression

### Cross-Session Workflow Optimization

**Session Handoff Preparation:**
1. Complete validation of all session state claims
2. Update session state with git commit references
3. Create compacted state for complex active work
4. Document clear resumption priorities and context

**Session Resumption Best Practices:**
1. Run pre-session validation checklist
2. Verify git branch alignment and recent commits  
3. Load appropriate agent pairing based on work context
4. Re-establish specialist agent coordination as needed
