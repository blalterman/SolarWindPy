# Phase 1: Core Principles & Framework

## Phase Tasks
- [ ] **Establish Git-First Validation** (Est: 1 hour) - Implement git commit history as authoritative source
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
- [ ] **Build Infrastructure Priority Framework** (Est: 30 min) - Create development priority ordering system
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
- [ ] **Design Context Switching Prevention Rules** (Est: 30 min) - Define completion-before-new-work principles
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending

## Core Principles

### 1. Git-First Validation
**Philosophy:** Git commit history is the authoritative source of truth for project state
- Session state files are **secondary indicators** that may become stale
- Always cross-reference session state claims with actual git commits
- Resolve discrepancies by favoring git evidence over session file content

### 2. Infrastructure Priority Framework  
**Development Priority Order:**
1. **Critical Infrastructure** (CI/CD failures, build system issues)
2. **Active Plans** (90%+ complete work requiring finishing touches)  
3. **New Features** (planned feature development)
4. **Enhancements** (optimization, refactoring, documentation improvements)

### 3. Context Switching Prevention
**Rule:** Complete active work before starting new initiatives
- Finish partially completed infrastructure work first
- Avoid abandoning high-completion work for new projects
- Use compaction system to extend sessions rather than switching contexts

## Implementation Notes
This phase establishes the foundational principles that guide all session continuity decisions and prevents productivity losses from context switching.
