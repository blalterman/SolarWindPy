# Phase 1: Sphinx Build Diagnostics and Warning Audit

## Phase Metadata
- **Phase**: 1/6
- **Estimated Duration**: 1.5 hours
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Status**: Not Started

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase Objective
Perform comprehensive analysis of Sphinx build system to identify all warnings, errors, and HTML rendering failures. Establish baseline understanding of documentation infrastructure issues and create systematic remediation roadmap.

## ðŸ§  Phase Context
Before fixing documentation issues, we must understand the full scope of problems. This phase provides the diagnostic foundation for all subsequent fixes by cataloging every warning, error, and rendering failure in the Sphinx build system.

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Tasks

### Task Group 1: Build Environment Validation
- [ ] **Validate Documentation Environment** (Est: 15 min) - Ensure solarwindpy-20250404 environment is active and Sphinx dependencies are available
  - Commit: `<checksum>` 
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: DocumentationMaintainer will verify environment setup
- [ ] **Check Sphinx Configuration** (Est: 15 min) - Review docs/conf.py for basic configuration issues and version compatibility
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Identify any obvious configuration problems

### Task Group 2: Build Execution and Warning Capture
- [ ] **Execute Clean Documentation Build** (Est: 20 min) - Run `make clean && make html` and capture all warnings/errors
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Generate fresh build with complete warning log
- [ ] **Categorize Sphinx Warnings** (Est: 30 min) - Systematically categorize all warnings by type (docstring, cross-reference, configuration, etc.)
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Create structured warning inventory

### Task Group 3: HTML Rendering Analysis
- [ ] **Audit Problem HTML Pages** (Est: 20 min) - Manually inspect solarwindpy.fitfunctions.html, solarwindpy.core.html, solarwindpy.instabilities.html, solarwindpy.solar_activity.html
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Document specific rendering failures and missing content
- [ ] **Compare Working vs Broken Pages** (Est: 10 min) - Identify patterns between properly rendered pages and problematic ones
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Look for common patterns in rendering failures

## âœ… Phase Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete Sphinx build warning inventory created and categorized
- [ ] All problematic HTML pages identified with specific rendering issues documented
- [ ] Baseline documentation build metrics established
- [ ] Environment and configuration validated
- [ ] Systematic remediation roadmap created based on diagnostic findings
- [ ] Priority order established for fixing different types of issues

## ðŸ§ª Phase Testing Strategy
- **Build Validation**: Ensure clean build environment and reproducible build process
- **Warning Analysis**: Systematic categorization of all Sphinx warnings and errors
- **HTML Inspection**: Manual verification of HTML output quality and completeness

## ðŸ”§ Phase Technical Requirements
- **Environment**: solarwindpy-20250404 conda environment active
- **Tools**: Sphinx, make, web browser for HTML inspection
- **Documentation**: Access to docs/source/ and docs/build/ directories

## ðŸ“‚ Phase Affected Areas
- `docs/build/` - Generated documentation for analysis
- `docs/source/` - Source files for configuration review
- Warning logs and diagnostic reports (temporary files)

## ðŸ“Š Phase Progress Tracking

### Current Status
- **Tasks Completed**: 0/6
- **Time Invested**: 0h of 1.5h
- **Completion Percentage**: 0%
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-13

### Blockers & Issues
- None anticipated for diagnostic phase

### Next Actions
- Activate documentation environment
- Execute clean Sphinx build with warning capture
- Begin systematic warning categorization

## ðŸ’¬ Phase Implementation Notes

### Implementation Decisions
- Focus on comprehensive diagnosis before any fixes to ensure systematic approach
- Use DocumentationMaintainer agent for technical analysis with coordination from planning agents

### Lessons Learned
[To be populated during implementation]

### Phase Dependencies Resolution
- No dependencies for this initial diagnostic phase
- Provides foundation for all subsequent phases
