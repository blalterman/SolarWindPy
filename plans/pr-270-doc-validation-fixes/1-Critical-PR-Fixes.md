# Phase 1: Critical PR Check Fixes

## Overview
**Goal**: Fix immediate PR #270 check failures to unblock the pull request
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Prerequisites**: None
**Outputs**: All GitHub Actions checks passing

## Context
PR #270 currently has failing checks:
- GitHub Actions using deprecated artifacts/upload-artifact@v3 (needs v4 migration)
- doc8 linting failures (trailing whitespace, line length violations) 
- ReadTheDocs build failures (needs diagnosis)
- Doctest validation failures (aggregate-results failing)

## Tasks

### Task 1.1: Fix GitHub Actions Artifacts Migration
**Estimated Time**: 45-60 minutes
- [ ] **Update .github/workflows/doctest-validation.yml**
  - [ ] Replace `actions/upload-artifact@v3` with `@v4`
  - [ ] Replace `actions/download-artifact@v3` with `@v4`
  - [ ] Update artifact syntax for v4 compatibility
  - [ ] Test workflow execution
- [ ] **Update .github/workflows/documentation.yml**
  - [ ] Replace `actions/upload-artifact@v3` with `@v4`
  - [ ] Update build artifact handling for v4
  - [ ] Verify deployment workflow compatibility
- [ ] **Verify workflow dependencies**
  - [ ] Check for additional v3 usage across all workflows
  - [ ] Update any remaining deprecated action versions
  - [ ] Validate workflow syntax and execution paths

### Task 1.2: Resolve doc8 Linting Violations
**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes
- [ ] **Run doc8 locally to identify issues**
  - [ ] Execute: `doc8 docs/ --max-line-length=88 --ignore=D002,D004`
  - [ ] Catalog all trailing whitespace violations
  - [ ] Identify line length violations
- [ ] **Fix documentation formatting**
  - [ ] Remove trailing whitespace from all .rst/.md files
  - [ ] Break long lines to comply with 88-character limit
  - [ ] Ensure consistent indentation in code blocks
- [ ] **Verify doc8 compliance**
  - [ ] Re-run doc8 to confirm zero violations
  - [ ] Check that formatting changes don't break documentation

### Task 1.3: Diagnose and Fix ReadTheDocs Failure
**Estimated Time**: 45-60 minutes
- [ ] **Analyze ReadTheDocs build logs**
  - [ ] Access failed build at https://app.readthedocs.org/projects/solarwindpy/builds/29283465/
  - [ ] Identify specific error causing build failure
  - [ ] Determine if related to documentation validation changes
- [ ] **Fix ReadTheDocs configuration**
  - [ ] Check `.readthedocs.yaml` for syntax errors
  - [ ] Verify Python environment and dependency compatibility
  - [ ] Update configuration if needed for validation framework
- [ ] **Validate ReadTheDocs build**
  - [ ] Test build locally using RTD environment
  - [ ] Verify documentation renders correctly
  - [ ] Check that all internal links resolve

### Task 1.4: Fix Doctest Validation Aggregate Results
**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes
- [ ] **Analyze aggregate-results failure**
  - [ ] Review GitHub Actions logs for aggregate-results step
  - [ ] Identify which doctest results are causing aggregation failure
  - [ ] Check if related to validation framework complexity
- [ ] **Fix aggregation logic**
  - [ ] Repair result parsing in aggregation script
  - [ ] Handle edge cases in validation result formats
  - [ ] Ensure proper error reporting for failed examples
- [ ] **Verify doctest pipeline**
  - [ ] Test doctest execution across Python 3.9-3.11
  - [ ] Confirm aggregate-results step completes successfully
  - [ ] Validate that essential physics examples execute

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] All GitHub Actions workflows show green checkmarks
- [ ] doc8 linting passes with zero violations
- [ ] ReadTheDocs builds and deploys successfully
- [ ] Doctest validation completes without aggregate failures
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

## Implementation Notes
**GitHub Actions Migration:**
- v4 artifacts use different upload/download syntax
- Artifact names and paths may need adjustment
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing artifact consumers

**Documentation Linting:**
- Use aggressive automated fixing where safe
- Manual review for complex formatting issues
- Preserve semantic meaning while fixing syntax

**ReadTheDocs Integration:**
- RTD environment may have different constraints than local build
- Documentation validation framework may conflict with RTD build process
- Consider disabling validation framework for RTD builds if necessary

## Git Commit
**At phase completion, commit with:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve PR #270 check failures for documentation validation

- Migrate GitHub Actions from artifacts@v3 to @v4
- Fix doc8 trailing whitespace and line length violations
- Resolve ReadTheDocs build failures
- Fix doctest validation aggregate-results step
- Ensure all CI/CD checks pass for PR #270

Checksum: <checksum>"
```

## Next Phase
Proceed to [Phase 2: Framework Right-Sizing](./2-Framework-Right-Sizing.md) to address the underlying over-engineering that contributed to these failures.
