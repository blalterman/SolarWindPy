  - [ ] Common validation failures and resolution
  - [ ] Performance optimization techniques
  - [ ] When to consider framework enhancements vs. maintaining simplicity
- [ ] **Document sustainability metrics**
  - [ ] Framework complexity: ~300 lines (90% reduction achieved)
  - [ ] Execution time: <5 minutes (significant improvement)
  - [ ] Maintenance burden: Appropriate for research package team
  - [ ] Functionality: Essential physics validation preserved

### Task 4.4: Plan Completion and Cleanup
**Estimated Time**: 5-10 minutes
- [ ] **Update plan status**
  - [ ] Mark all phase tasks as completed
