## üéØ Objective
Fix PR #270 failures and right-size the documentation validation framework from over-engineered 3000+ lines to appropriate ~300 lines for a scientific Python package with 47 documentation examples.

## üß† Context
**Current Situation:**
- PR #270 has multiple check failures: GitHub Actions v3 deprecation, doc8 linting errors, ReadTheDocs build failures
- Documentation validation framework is over-engineered: 3000+ lines of code for 47 examples with 85.7% failure rate
- Framework complexity exceeds requirements for scientific package documentation needs
- Maintenance burden is unsustainable for project scope and team size

**Problem Analysis:**
- GitHub Actions using deprecated artifacts/upload-artifact@v3 ‚Üí needs v4 migration
- doc8 linting failures: trailing whitespace and line length violations

## üîß Technical Requirements
- GitHub Actions: artifacts/upload-artifact@v4
- doc8: trailing whitespace and line length compliance
- ReadTheDocs: working build pipeline
- Python 3.9-3.11 compatibility
- Simplified validation framework: ~300 lines total
- Maintain existing doctest functionality
- Preserve CI/CD integration points
