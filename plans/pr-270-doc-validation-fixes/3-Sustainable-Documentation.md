# Phase 3: Sustainable Documentation Process

## Overview
**Goal**: Establish sustainable documentation validation process appropriate for scientific package
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
**Prerequisites**: Phase 2 completed (framework right-sized)
**Outputs**: Updated guidelines, minimal validation approach, sustainable maintenance

## Context
With the framework right-sized, establish sustainable practices:
- **Focus**: Essential documentation validation for 47 examples
- **Approach**: Minimal effective validation vs. comprehensive analysis
- **Maintenance**: Proportional to team capacity and package scope
- **Quality**: Sufficient for scientific package documentation needs

## Tasks

### Task 3.1: Create Minimal Validation Approach
**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes
- [ ] **Define essential validation criteria**
  - [ ] Physics examples must execute without errors
  - [ ] Core scientific functionality must be demonstrated correctly
  - [ ] Basic syntax and import validation for all examples
  - [ ] Performance: Validation should complete in <5 minutes
- [ ] **Implement targeted validation**
  - [ ] Focus on `core/` module examples (plasma physics, ions, vectors)
  - [ ] Validate `instabilities/` examples (scientific calculations)
  - [ ] Basic checks for `plotting/` and `fitfunctions/` examples
  - [ ] Skip complex enterprise-style validation patterns
- [ ] **Create validation priorities**
  - [ ] **Critical**: Physics correctness, core functionality
  - [ ] **Important**: Import success, basic execution
  - [ ] **Optional**: Formatting, style, advanced features
  - [ ] **Excluded**: Enterprise metrics, complex analytics

### Task 3.2: Update Contributor Guidelines
**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes
- [ ] **Update documentation standards in CONTRIBUTING.md**
  - [ ] Define minimal documentation requirements for new features
  - [ ] Specify when documentation validation is required vs. optional
  - [ ] Provide guidance on appropriate complexity for examples
- [ ] **Create documentation contribution workflow**
  - [ ] Simple workflow: Write example → Test locally → Submit PR
  - [ ] Validation: Automated CI checks essential functionality
  - [ ] Review: Human review focuses on scientific accuracy
- [ ] **Document validation framework usage**
  - [ ] How to run validation locally: `python scripts/simple_doc_validation/doctest_runner.py`
  - [ ] When to use full vs. minimal validation
  - [ ] Troubleshooting common validation issues

### Task 3.3: Streamline CI/CD Pipeline
**Estimated Time**: 20-30 minutes
- [ ] **Optimize GitHub Actions execution**
  - [ ] Reduce validation matrix (focus on Python 3.10, spot-check others)
  - [ ] Implement early termination for obvious failures
  - [ ] Cache dependencies to reduce execution time
- [ ] **Simplify reporting**
  - [ ] Essential metrics only: pass/fail counts, execution time
  - [ ] Remove complex analytics and enterprise-style reporting
  - [ ] Clear failure messages for debugging
- [ ] **Right-size CI resources**
  - [ ] Appropriate runner sizing for scientific package
  - [ ] Efficient artifact handling (only essential outputs)
  - [ ] Reasonable timeout values (avoid infinite runs)

### Task 3.4: Remove Excessive Documentation
**Estimated Time**: 15-30 minutes
- [ ] **Audit documentation for over-engineering**
  - [ ] Remove enterprise-scale validation documentation
  - [ ] Simplify complex configuration guides
  - [ ] Focus on essential user and contributor needs
- [ ] **Update README and documentation**
  - [ ] Reflect simplified validation approach
  - [ ] Remove references to archived complex framework
  - [ ] Update installation and usage instructions
- [ ] **Clean up configuration files**
  - [ ] Remove unused validation configuration
  - [ ] Simplify `.readthedocs.yaml` if needed
  - [ ] Update any references to archived components

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] Documentation validation completes in <5 minutes
- [ ] Essential physics examples validate correctly
- [ ] Contributor guidelines updated for sustainable approach
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline optimized for efficiency
- [ ] Excessive documentation removed
- [ ] Clear distinction between essential vs. optional validation
- [ ] Maintenance burden appropriate for research package team

## Implementation Notes
**Sustainable Validation Principles:**
- **Proportional Complexity**: Tools match package scope (47 examples, not 1000+)
- **Essential Focus**: Physics correctness over comprehensive analysis
- **Team Capacity**: Maintenance burden matches available resources
- **User Experience**: Simple contribution workflow for researchers

**Quality Standards:**
- Scientific accuracy is non-negotiable
- Basic functionality validation is essential
- Advanced analytics are optional enhancements
- Documentation serves users and contributors, not tooling systems

**Maintenance Approach:**
- Regular validation of core physics examples
- Spot-checking of new contributions
- Quarterly review of validation effectiveness
- Annual assessment of framework appropriateness

## Git Commit
**At phase completion, commit with:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "docs: establish sustainable documentation validation process

- Create minimal validation approach focused on 47 examples
- Update contributor guidelines for sustainable practices
- Streamline CI/CD pipeline for efficiency
- Remove excessive documentation and configuration
- Focus on essential physics validation over enterprise features
- Establish maintenance approach appropriate for research package
