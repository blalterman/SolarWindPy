# GitHub Workflows Audit & Repair Plan

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive plan audits and repairs the GitHub workflows in the SolarWindPy repository. Key issues identified include auto-publishing on every master push (critical security risk), limited CI testing scope, and redundant documentation workflows. The plan implements safe tag-based deployment, matrix testing across multiple platforms, security scanning, and comprehensive automation while maintaining rollback capabilities through phased git commits.

## Workflow Overview & Current Issues

### 1. **CI Workflow (ci.yml)** - NEEDS ENHANCEMENT
**Purpose**: Core continuous integration for code quality and testing
**Current Triggers**: Push to master/update-2025, Pull requests
**Value Proposition**: Essential - ensures code quality, catches bugs early, maintains standards
**Current Issues**:
- Only tests Python 3.8 (package supports 3.7-4.0)
- Only tests on Ubuntu (missing macOS/Windows)
- No OS matrix testing
- Missing coverage reporting
- No caching for dependencies
- Limited branch coverage

### 2. **Publish Workflow (publish.yml)** ⚠️ CRITICAL RISK
**Purpose**: Automatically publishes to PyPI on every master push
**Value Proposition**: Dangerous as configured - should be manual or tag-based
**Current Issues**:
- **CRITICAL**: Auto-publishes on every master push (high risk)
- Requires PYPI_API_TOKEN secret (may not be configured)
- No version checking before publish
- Could publish broken releases
- No testing of package before publication

### 3. **Deploy Docs (deploy-docs.yml)** - REDUNDANT
**Purpose**: Builds and deploys documentation to GitHub Pages
**Value Proposition**: High - provides automated documentation hosting
**Current Issues**:
- Redundant with doc-build.yml
- May conflict with ReadTheDocs badge shown in README
- No caching for build dependencies

### 4. **Docs Build (doc-build.yml)** - REDUNDANT
**Purpose**: Tests documentation building on PRs and pushes
**Value Proposition**: Medium - validates docs but redundant with deploy-docs
**Current Issues**:
- Duplicates much of deploy-docs.yml logic
- Should be consolidated

### 5. **Sync Requirements (sync-requirements.yml)** - CONFIGURATION ISSUES
**Purpose**: Auto-syncs requirements across multiple files when requirements-dev.txt changes
**Value Proposition**: High - maintains consistency across requirement files
**Current Issues**:
- Hardcoded conda environment name (solarwindpy-20250404)
- May fail if scripts are missing
- Auto-commits could cause conflicts
- No validation of generated files

### 6. **Update Workflow Doc (update-workflow-doc.yml)** - UNCLEAR VALUE
**Purpose**: Updates PR references in documentation
**Value Proposition**: Low - unclear functionality, script may not exist
**Current Issues**:
- References potentially non-existent script
- Purpose unclear without seeing the script
- May not provide significant value

## Implementation Plan with Git Checkpoints

### Phase 1: Critical Security & Configuration Fixes (Immediate)

#### 1.1 Fix CI Workflow - Enable All Branches + Matrix Testing
**File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
**Changes**:
- Trigger on ALL branches (not just master/update-2025)
- Add matrix testing for Python 3.8-3.11

- Add manual trigger with dry-run option
- Add version verification
- Add package verification with twine
- Add TestPyPI deployment for release candidates
- Add production PyPI deployment for stable releases
- Add GitHub release creation with artifacts

**Git Checkpoint**: "fix(ci): enable matrix testing on all branches and tag-based publishing"

### Phase 2: Security Scanning (High Priority)

#### 2.1 Add Security Workflow
**New File**: `.github/workflows/security.yml`
**Features**:
- Bandit security scan for Python code
- Safety check for dependency vulnerabilities
- pip-audit for additional vulnerability scanning
- Scheduled weekly scans
- Artifact upload for security reports
- Critical vulnerability detection and alerting

**Git Checkpoint**: "feat(security): add security scanning workflow with Bandit, Safety, pip-audit"

### Phase 3: Documentation Consolidation (Medium Priority)

#### 3.1 Consolidated Documentation Workflow
**Replace**: `doc-build.yml` and `deploy-docs.yml` with single `docs.yml`
**Features**:
- Build documentation on all branches for testing
- Deploy to GitHub Pages only from master
- Add dependency caching
- Add link checking
- Add documentation coverage reporting
- Upload documentation artifacts

**Git Checkpoint**: "refactor(docs): consolidate documentation workflows with caching"

### Phase 4: Branch Protection Automation (Medium Priority)

#### 4.1 Branch Protection Workflow
**New File**: `.github/workflows/branch-protection.yml`

**What is Branch Protection?**
Branch protection rules enforce certain workflows before code can be merged into important branches (like `master` or `main`). They act as quality gates to ensure code meets your standards.

**Value Proposition:**
1. **Prevents Accidental Breaks**: No one can push directly to master without PR review
2. **Enforces Quality Standards**: Requires CI tests to pass before merging
3. **Mandates Code Review**: Ensures at least one other person reviews changes
4. **Prevents Force Pushes**: Protects commit history from being rewritten
5. **Maintains Deployment Safety**: Ensures only tested, reviewed code reaches production

**Why You Want It:**
- **Risk Reduction**: Catches bugs before they reach main branch
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Code reviews spread knowledge across team
- **Compliance**: Many organizations require it for security/audit
- **Rollback Safety**: Clean history makes it easier to revert problematic changes
- **Automated Quality**: CI must pass = no broken builds in main

**Features**:
- Manual trigger for configuring branch protection
- Requires CI success before merge
- Requires code review approval
- Prevents force pushes
- Applies to master/main branches

**Git Checkpoint**: "feat(workflows): add branch protection automation"

### Phase 5: Dependency Management (Low Priority)

#### 5.1 Dependabot Configuration
**New File**: `.github/dependabot.yml`
**Features**:
- Weekly Python dependency updates
- Monthly GitHub Actions updates
- Grouped updates for related packages
- Automatic labeling and commit message formatting

#### 5.2 Requirements Sync Enhancement
**File**: `.github/workflows/sync-requirements.yml`
**Enhancements**:
- Dynamic conda environment naming
- File validation before commit
- Pull request creation instead of direct commits
- Better error handling
- Support for manual triggers with custom suffixes

**Git Checkpoint**: "feat(deps): add Dependabot and enhance requirements sync"

### Phase 6: Performance Monitoring (Low Priority)

#### 6.1 Performance Benchmarking
**New File**: `.github/workflows/benchmark.yml`
**Features**:
- pytest-benchmark integration
- Performance regression detection
- Benchmark result storage
- Alert on significant performance degradation

**Git Checkpoint**: "feat(perf): add performance benchmarking workflow"

**Features**:
- Automated release preparation
- Version bumping
- Changelog generation
- Release branch creation
- Tag creation and pushing

**Git Checkpoint**: "feat(release): add comprehensive release management workflow"

### Phase 8: Documentation & Cleanup

## Required Repository Secrets

### Essential (needed when PYPI_API_TOKEN is available in ~2 weeks):
- **PYPI_API_TOKEN**: Production PyPI uploads
- **TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN**: Test PyPI uploads (recommended)

### Recommended:
- **CODECOV_TOKEN**: Coverage reporting (optional)
- **PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN**: For workflows that create PRs (optional, can use GITHUB_TOKEN)

## Success Metrics

### Immediate Goals:
- ✅ CI runs on all branches with full matrix testing (Python 3.8-3.11, Ubuntu/macOS/Windows)
- ✅ Security scanning identifies vulnerabilities across all code changes
- ✅ Documentation builds are cached, validated, and artifacted
- ✅ No accidental PyPI deployments (tag-based only)
- ✅ Branch protection prevents untested code from reaching master

### Long-term Goals:
- ✅ 95%+ test coverage across all OS/Python combinations
- ✅ Zero high-severity security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Automated dependency updates via Dependabot
- ✅ Performance regressions automatically detected
- ✅ Release process fully automated and safe
- ✅ Comprehensive workflow documentation maintained

## Rollback Strategy

Each phase includes a git commit creating a checkpoint. If any phase fails:

```bash
# View commit history
git log --oneline -10

# Rollback to previous checkpoint if needed
git reset --hard <commit-hash>

# Or rollback specific files
git checkout <commit-hash> -- .github/workflows/
```

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Test in Feature Branch First**: All changes tested before merging to master
2. **Phased Implementation**: Each phase is independent and can be rolled back
3. **Dry-Run Capabilities**: Publish workflow includes dry-run option for testing
4. **Continue-on-Error**: Non-critical steps don't fail entire workflow
5. **Artifact Preservation**: Important outputs are saved as artifacts
6. **Documentation**: Clear documentation for troubleshooting and maintenance

## Post-Implementation Maintenance

- Review Dependabot PRs
- Check security scan results
- Validate performance benchmarks
- Update workflow documentation

### Quarterly Tasks:
- Review and update Python version matrix
