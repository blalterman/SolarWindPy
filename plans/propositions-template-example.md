# Example: Propositions Template Enhancement

## ðŸ“ˆ Plan Propositions

### Risk Proposition
**Technical Risks**:
- LOW: Template modification only, no code changes required
- MINIMAL: Existing plans unaffected, only new plans use enhanced template
- NEGLIGIBLE: No breaking changes to planning workflow

**Scientific Risks**:
- NONE: No impact on physics calculations or scientific correctness
- BENEFICIAL: Better documentation of scientific validation decisions

**Operational Risks**:
- LOW: May slow initial planning by 10-15 minutes per plan
- MEDIUM: Learning curve for comprehensive proposition analysis
- LOW: Risk of over-analysis paralysis for simple changes

**Risk Mitigation Strategies**:
- Provide clear examples and decision criteria
- Phase in gradually with optional adoption initially
- Create proposition quality guidelines and templates

### Value Proposition
**Scientific Value**:
- HIGH: Enables evidence-based resource allocation for grant-funded research
- HIGH: Provides audit trail for scientific computing decisions and trade-offs
- MEDIUM: Improves reproducibility through documented decision rationale

**Developer Value**:
- HIGH: Reduces wasted effort on low-value work by 30-40%
- MEDIUM: Better cross-plan prioritization and resource conflict resolution
- HIGH: Knowledge preservation for multi-year research software lifecycles

**User Value**:
- MEDIUM: Better prioritization leads to faster delivery of high-value features
- LOW: Indirect benefit through improved development efficiency

**ROI Timeline**:
- Immediate: Decision-making framework for active plans
- 1-3 months: Pattern documentation reducing re-work
- 6+ months: Institutional knowledge base for research software development

### Cost Proposition
**Development Time**:
- 1.5 hours implementation (templates, documentation, integration)
- High confidence (Â±15 minutes) - straightforward documentation task

**Review & Testing Time**:
- 0.25 hours validation with example plans
- Low complexity validation requirement

**Maintenance Cost**:
- MINIMAL: Self-documenting propositions require little ongoing maintenance
- ANNUAL: ~0.5 hours to update templates based on usage learnings

**Opportunity Cost**:
- LOW: High-leverage documentation improvement
- MINIMAL: Defers no critical development work

### Token Proposition
**Planning Tokens**:
- 500 tokens for template development and documentation updates
- 300 tokens for integration with UnifiedPlanCoordinator and closeout

**Implementation Tokens**:
- 200 tokens per plan for comprehensive propositions analysis
- 150 tokens for proposition validation and quality checking

**Future Token Savings**:
- 300-500 tokens per plan from better prioritization decisions
- 200 tokens reduced planning overhead through documented patterns
- 100 tokens saved from avoiding low-value initiatives

**Net Token ROI**:
- Break-even after 2-3 plans with full propositions
- Positive ROI within 1 month given typical plan frequency
- Multiplicative benefits for cross-plan decision making

### Usage Proposition
**Target Users**:
- PRIMARY: All SolarWindPy developers and contributors
- SECONDARY: Research collaborators and grant reviewers
- TERTIARY: Academic institutions using SolarWindPy for plasma physics research

**Usage Frequency**:
- 5-10 new plans per month requiring propositions analysis
- Weekly cross-plan prioritization decisions using proposition data
- Quarterly research planning using accumulated proposition insights

**Coverage Scope**:
- 100% of future development work through required template usage
- 80% of development resource allocation decisions
- 90% of technical debt and priority resolution discussions

**Adoption Requirements**:
- One comprehensive example walkthrough with team
- Updated documentation and template usage guide
- NO training required - self-evident through examples and guidance
