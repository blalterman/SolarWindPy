# Test Planning Agents Architecture - Overview

## Plan Metadata
- **Plan Name**: Test Planning Agents Architecture
- **Created**: 2025-08-09
- **Branch**: plan/test-planning-agents-architecture
- **Implementation Branch**: feature/test-planning-agents-architecture
- **PlanManager**: PlanManager
- **PlanImplementer**: PlanImplementer
- **Structure**: Multi-Phase
- **Total Phases**: 3
- **Dependencies**: Planning agents system implementation
- **Affects**: .claude/agents/, planning agent test infrastructure
- **Estimated Duration**: 20 minutes
- **Status**: COMPLETED

## PlanImplementer Fields
- **Implementation Strategy**: Test-driven validation
- **Testing Approach**: Branch isolation and workflow validation
- **Rollback Plan**: N/A (testing only, no production changes)
- **Performance Impact**: None
- **Security Considerations**: Git branch permissions only

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Validate the plan-per-branch architecture by testing branch isolation, cross-branch coordination, and the complete merge workflow (feature â†’ plan â†’ master).

## ðŸ§  Context
Testing the planning agents system we just implemented to ensure:
1. Plan branches can be created and isolated properly
2. Feature branches can coordinate with plan branches
3. Checksum management works correctly
4. Merge workflow operates as designed (feature â†’ plan â†’ master)

## ðŸ”§ Technical Requirements
- Git branch management
- Plan template system
- Checksum placeholder system (`<checksum>`)
- Cross-branch file coordination

## ðŸ“‚ Affected Areas
- `.claude/agents/` - New planning agents
- `solarwindpy/plans/` - Plan templates and test plans
- Git branches - Plan and feature branch architecture

## ðŸ“‹ Phase Structure
1. **Phase 1**: Branch Isolation Testing (8 min)
2. **Phase 2**: Cross-Branch Coordination (7 min)
3. **Phase 3**: Merge Workflow Testing (5 min)

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Plan branch created successfully with isolated plan files
- [x] Feature branch can coordinate with plan branch
- [x] Checksum placeholders can be replaced with actual commit hashes
- [x] Cross-branch status updates work correctly
- [x] Complete merge workflow (feature â†’ plan â†’ master) functions properly
- [x] Branch isolation maintains true separation between concurrent plans

## ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy
1. **Branch Creation**: Verify plan and feature branches can be created independently
2. **File Isolation**: Confirm plan files only exist on their respective plan branches
3. **Checksum Functionality**: Test placeholder replacement with real commit hashes
4. **Cross-Branch Updates**: Validate status synchronization between branches
5. **Merge Workflow**: Complete full workflow from feature through to master

## ðŸ“Š Final Results
- **Phases Completed**: 3/3
- **Tasks Completed**: 8/8
- **Time Invested**: 0.33h of 0.33h
- **Final Status**: COMPLETED âœ…

## ðŸ”— Related Plans
- Primary implementation: Planning agents system (completed)
- Future testing: Status tracking system validation

## ðŸ’¬ Notes & Considerations
This is a meta-test of our planning system - using the planning agents to test themselves. This validates that the plan-per-branch architecture can handle recursive planning scenarios.

*This plan follows the plan-per-branch architecture where implementation occurs on feature/test-planning-agents-architecture branch with progress tracked via commit checksums.*
