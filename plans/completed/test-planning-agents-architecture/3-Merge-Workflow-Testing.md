# Phase 3: Merge Workflow Testing

## Phase Overview
- **Duration**: 5 minutes
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Objective**: Test complete merge workflow from feature branch through to master

## Tasks

### Task 3.1: Test feature → plan merge
- **Estimate**: 2 minutes
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Commit**: `6a036fe`
- **Description**: Merge feature branch into plan branch

**Implementation Notes:**
- Feature to plan merge completed successfully
- No conflicts encountered during merge process
- Branch coordination maintained throughout merge

### Task 3.2: Test plan → master merge
- **Estimate**: 3 minutes
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Commit**: `a523eb0`
- **Description**: Complete merge workflow to master

**Implementation Notes:**
- Plan to master merge completed successfully
- Complete merge workflow validated: feature → plan → master
- Planning agents architecture fully validated
- All branch operations functioned as designed

## Phase Results
- **Tasks Completed**: 2/2
- **Time Taken**: 5 minutes (as estimated)
- **Key Achievements**:
  - Successfully completed full merge workflow
  - Validated feature → plan → master progression
  - Confirmed planning agents architecture integrity
  - Established confidence in branch management system

## Final Phase Summary
The merge workflow testing phase successfully validated the complete architecture:
