```bash
# Test: Verify all agent references exist and are current
Test Cases:
1. Validate .claude/agents/agent-plan-manager.md exists and accessible
2. Validate .claude/agents/agent-plan-implementer.md exists and accessible  
3. Validate .claude/agents/agent-plan-status-aggregator.md exists and accessible
4. Confirm no references to obsolete agent variants (Full/Streamlined/Minimal)
5. Verify integration protocols match actual agent capabilities

Expected Results:
✓ All file references resolve correctly
✓ No obsolete agent type references remain
✓ Integration logic aligns with actual agent features
✓ Agent coordination protocols work with current architecture
```

#### Agent Workflow Integration
```bash
# Test: CompactionAgent integration with PlanManager workflow
Test Scenario: PlanManager approaching 1,200 token limit
1. Simulate PlanManager context with plan inventory, active phase, velocity data
2. Trigger CompactionAgent with realistic PlanManager content
3. Validate compression achieves 33-50% reduction target
4. Verify essential context preserved (current phase, next tasks, dependencies)
5. Test resumption workflow restores PlanManager state correctly

Expected Results:
✓ Compression: 1200 → 600-800 tokens achieved
✓ Context quality: Essential planning information preserved
✓ Resumption: PlanManager workflow continues seamlessly
```

```bash  
# Test: CompactionAgent integration with PlanImplementer workflow
Test Scenario: PlanImplementer approaching 1,200 token limit during implementation
1. Simulate PlanImplementer context with branch state, pending tasks, QA status
2. Trigger CompactionAgent with realistic PlanImplementer content
3. Validate compression achieves 33-50% reduction target  
4. Verify essential context preserved (branch coordination, integration points)
5. Test resumption workflow restores PlanImplementer state correctly

Expected Results:
✓ Compression: 1200 → 600-800 tokens achieved
✓ Context quality: Essential implementation information preserved
✓ Resumption: PlanImplementer workflow continues seamlessly
```

### Compression Efficiency Validation (T7.2)

#### Token Reduction Testing
```bash
# Test: Validate realistic compression targets achieved
Compression Test Cases:
1. PlanManager (1,200 tokens) → Target: 600-800 tokens (33-50% reduction)
2. PlanImplementer (1,200 tokens) → Target: 600-800 tokens (33-50% reduction)  
3. PlanStatusAggregator (400 tokens) → Target: 200-300 tokens (25-50% reduction)
4. System Overhead: <50 tokens per compaction operation

Validation Metrics:
✓ Compression ratios within target ranges
✓ Quality preservation maintained at target compression
✓ System overhead below 2% of token baseline (50/2400)
✓ Session extension: 2-3x effective capacity demonstrated
```

#### Quality vs Efficiency Balance
```bash
# Test: Validate compression quality vs efficiency tradeoffs
Quality Preservation Test:
1. Essential Context: Next tasks, dependencies, progress state preserved
2. Workflow Continuity: Session resumption maintains development momentum  
3. Integration Points: Specialist agent connections preserved
4. Git Validation: Commit-linked progress verification maintained

Expected Results:
✓ >95% essential context preserved through compression
✓ Session continuity quality maintained or improved
✓ Specialist integration intact after compression  
✓ Git-first validation capabilities preserved
```

### Session Continuity Quality Testing (T7.3)

#### Resumption Quality Validation
```bash
# Test: Session resumption quality after compression
Session Continuity Test Cases:
1. **PlanManager Resumption**: 
   - Restore plan inventory, velocity data, current phase context
   - Validate next session priorities accurate and actionable
   - Test time estimation learning preserved through compression

2. **PlanImplementer Resumption**:
   - Restore branch state, pending tasks, QA validation status
   - Validate implementation context sufficient for continuation
   - Test specialist coordination requirements preserved

Quality Metrics:
✓ <2 minutes to restore full context from compacted state
✓ Resumption accuracy: >95% of essential information available
✓ Workflow continuity: No development momentum lost
✓ Session extension: 2-3x effective development time achieved
```

#### Multi-Session Workflow Testing
```bash
# Test: Multi-session development workflow continuity  
Extended Session Test:
1. Session 1: Start development, compress at token limit
2. Session 2: Resume from compacted state, continue work, compress again
3. Session 3: Resume from second compression, validate quality maintained

Expected Results:
✓ Context quality maintained across multiple compression cycles
✓ Cumulative information loss <5% over 3 sessions
✓ Development velocity maintained across session boundaries
✓ Git validation integrity preserved throughout
```

### Git Integration Verification (T7.4)

#### Commit-Linked Validation Testing
```bash
# Test: Git-first validation capabilities preserved
Git Integration Test Cases:
1. **Progress Verification**: Compacted state accurately reflects git commit evidence
2. **Branch Coordination**: Plan ↔ feature branch sync preserved through compression
3. **Commit Tracking**: Recent commits properly referenced in compacted state
4. **Merge Workflow**: Completion workflow git operations work with compressed context

Expected Results:
✓ 100% git commit evidence accuracy in compacted states
✓ Branch synchronization state preserved through compression
✓ Commit references valid and accessible for progress validation  
✓ Git workflow operations continue seamlessly after resumption
```

### Template Structure Validation (T7.5)

#### Template Efficiency Testing
```bash
# Test: Optimized template structure functionality
Template Test Cases:
1. **Agent-Specific Sections**: PlanManager/PlanImplementer specific formats work correctly
2. **Metadata Accuracy**: Current architecture metadata populated correctly
3. **Resumption Instructions**: Streamlined instructions enable rapid context recovery
4. **Token Overhead**: Template structure overhead <100 tokens

Expected Results:
