## Plan Overview & Objective
Transform SolarWindPy's .claude/settings.json into a comprehensive, secure, and intelligent development ecosystem that fully integrates:

## 5-Phase Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Security Foundation & Permission Restructure (2.0h)
**Objective**: Implement defense-in-depth security with 6 security layers

**6-Layer Security Model**:
1. **Layer 1**: Granular pattern-based permissions (replace wildcards)
2. **Layer 2**: Input validation and argument sanitization  
3. **Layer 3**: Execution environment restrictions and resource limits
4. **Layer 4**: Comprehensive audit logging and monitoring
5. **Layer 5**: Enhanced deny list enforcement
6. **Layer 6**: Security monitoring and alerting

**Key Tasks** (12 tasks total):
- Analyze permission gaps and design granular patterns
- Implement hook-specific bash permissions with argument validation
- Add comprehensive deny patterns for sensitive files
- Create execution timeout controls and resource limits
- Design audit logging framework with security monitoring

**Critical Issues Addressed**:
- Overly restrictive permissions blocking legitimate hook execution
- Broad wildcard patterns creating potential security vulnerabilities
- Missing input validation enabling potential injection attacks
- No resource controls for hook execution
- Insufficient audit trails for security events

### Phase 2: Hook Integration & Configuration (1.5h)  
**Objective**: Integrate all 7 hooks with full argument utilization and intelligent triggering

**Missing Hook Integration**:
- **test-runner.sh**: Smart test execution with --changed, --physics, --coverage arguments
- **coverage-monitor.py**: Comprehensive coverage monitoring and reporting

**Enhanced Argument Utilization**:
- **test-runner.sh**: --changed, --physics, --coverage, --module, --timeout, --parallel
- **physics-validation.py**: --strict, --report, --fix, --scope  
- **git-workflow-validator.sh**: --enforce-branch, --check-tests, --validate-message

**Key Tasks** (12 tasks total):
- Integrate missing hooks with context-aware triggers
- Enhance hook arguments for contextual execution
- Implement intelligent triggering based on file changes
- Add hook coordination logic to prevent conflicts
- Configure performance limits and error handling

**Intelligent Triggering Design**:
- **Code Changes**: Trigger appropriate tests based on modified files

### Phase 3: Agent System Integration (1.5h)
**Objective**: Integrate 8-agent system with intelligent routing and context-aware suggestions

**Agent Routing Matrix**:
- **File-Based**: `core/*.py` → PhysicsValidator, `plotting/*.py` → PlottingEngineer
- **Keyword-Based**: "plan" → UnifiedPlanCoordinator, "plot" → PlottingEngineer
- **Context-Based**: Multi-step tasks → UnifiedPlanCoordinator, Physics calculations → PhysicsValidator

**Key Tasks** (12 tasks total):
- Implement context-aware agent routing with domain-specific triggers
- Add capability matrix defining when each agent should be suggested
- Create agent handoff protocols for complex task coordination
- Implement performance monitoring and fallback mechanisms
- Design prioritization logic for multiple relevant agents

**Agent Coordination Strategy**:
1. UnifiedPlanCoordinator for multi-step and planning tasks
2. Domain specialists for technical implementations  
3. TestEngineer for quality assurance and validation
4. Fallback to UnifiedPlanCoordinator with domain context

### Phase 4: Enhanced Workflow Automation (1.0h)
**Objective**: Create intelligent automation combining hooks, agents, and context awareness

**Automation Framework**:
- **File Change Analysis**: Map file patterns to automation triggers
- **User Intent Detection**: Parse prompts for task types and routing
- **Workflow State Tracking**: Adapt to Planning → Implementation → Testing → Review cycles

**Key Tasks** (9 tasks total):
- Implement smart context analysis and user intent detection
- Add proactive automation triggers for tests and quality gates
- Create adaptive learning from user patterns and preferences
- Implement contextual help and workflow shortcuts
- Design transparent, user-controllable automation

**Smart Automation Examples**:
- **Test Selection**: Core changes → physics tests, new functions → coverage checks
- **Quality Gates**: Pre-commit → formatting, Pre-push → full validation
- **Documentation**: API changes → docstring suggestions

### Phase 5: Validation & Monitoring (1.0h)
**Objective**: Establish comprehensive validation, monitoring, and rollback systems

**Validation Strategy**:
1. **Component Testing**: Each component works individually
2. **Integration Testing**: All components work together  
3. **Performance Testing**: System performs well under load
4. **Security Testing**: No vulnerabilities from integration
5. **User Experience Testing**: System enhances workflow

**Key Tasks** (9 tasks total):

## Technical Architecture

### Multi-Layered Security Approach
**Philosophy**: Defense-in-depth with fail-safe defaults
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary permissions
- **Granular Patterns**: File-specific instead of wildcards
- **Input Validation**: Prevent injection through arguments
- **Resource Controls**: Timeouts and limits for hook execution
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Audit trail for all security decisions

### Intelligent Hook Integration
**Coordination Logic**: 
- Prevent duplicate test runs from multiple triggers
- Context-aware argument selection based on file changes
- Performance optimization with parallel execution where possible
- Graceful degradation when hooks fail or timeout

### Agent Routing Intelligence
**Pattern Matching**:
- Fast regex-based file and keyword pattern matching
- Context preservation during agent transitions  
- Priority ordering with clear handoff protocols
- Performance monitoring with fallback mechanisms

### Workflow Automation Framework
**Core Principles**:
- **Helpful, Not Intrusive**: Enhance without interrupting workflow
- **Transparent**: Clear indication of automated actions and rationale
- **Controllable**: User customization and override capabilities
- **Learning**: Adaptation to user preferences and patterns
