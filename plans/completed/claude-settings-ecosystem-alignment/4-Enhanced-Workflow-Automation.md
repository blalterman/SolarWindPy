## ðŸ’¬ Phase Implementation Notes

### Workflow Automation Philosophy
**Core Principles:**
- **Helpful, Not Intrusive**: Automation should enhance, not interrupt workflow
- **Transparent**: Users should understand what automation is doing and why
- **Controllable**: Users can customize, disable, or override any automation
- **Learning**: System adapts to user preferences and patterns over time

### Context Analysis Framework
**File Change Analysis:**
- `core/*.py` â†’ Physics validation, relevant tests, documentation checks
- `tests/*.py` â†’ Test execution, coverage analysis, test quality checks
- `plotting/*.py` â†’ Visualization validation, example updates
- `fitfunctions/*.py` â†’ Curve fitting tests, numerical validation

**User Intent Detection:**
- Planning language â†’ UnifiedPlanCoordinator with plan templates
- Bug reports â†’ TestEngineer with debugging strategies
- Performance concerns â†’ NumericalStabilityGuard with profiling
- Visualization requests â†’ PlottingEngineer with plotting guidance

### Intelligent Automation Examples
**Smart Test Selection:**
- Core physics changes â†’ Run physics validation tests
- New functions â†’ Check test coverage and suggest test creation
