# Phase 3: Enhanced GitHub Integration

## Overview
- **Phase**: 3 of 3
- **Duration**: 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
- **Priority**: MEDIUM (ROI 7/10)
- **Dependencies**: Phases 1-2 (validated inputs, reliable routing)
- **Affects**: `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml`, documentation

## Objective
Optimize Claude Code's automated PR review workflow to provide more relevant, physics-aware feedback that leverages SolarWindPy's sophisticated agent routing system and domain expertise.

## Context
Current GitHub integration uses generic review prompts. With the improved agent routing and validation from Phases 1-2, we can now provide more targeted, SolarWindPy-specific review guidance that focuses on:
- Physics validation and unit consistency
- Solar wind domain expertise  
- Appropriate use of the 8-agent system
- Scientific code review standards

**ROI**: 7/10 - Improves review quality and reduces manual review time.

## Tasks

### Task 3.1: Enhance Claude Code Review Workflow (30 minutes)
**Priority**: MEDIUM (Better reviews save manual review time)

**File**: `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml`

#### Current Configuration Analysis
**Current Direct Prompt** (lines 19-26):
```yaml
direct_prompt: Please review this pull request and provide feedback on:
- Code quality and best practices
- Potential bugs or issues
- Performance considerations
- Security concerns
- Test coverage

Be constructive and helpful in your feedback.
```

#### Enhanced SolarWindPy-Specific Prompt

**Updated Configuration**:
```yaml
direct_prompt: |
  Please review this pull request for SolarWindPy, a solar wind physics analysis library.
  
  Focus your review on these SolarWindPy-specific areas:
  
  **Physics & Scientific Accuracy:**
  - Unit consistency (SI units internally, conversion for display only)
  - Thermal speed convention: mw² = 2kT
  - Alfvén speed calculations: V_A = B/√(μ₀ρ) with proper ion composition
  - Missing data handling (NaN, never 0 or -999)
  - Time series chronological order preservation
  
  **Code Quality & Architecture:**
  - MultiIndex DataFrame patterns (M/C/S structure: Measurement/Component/Species)
  - Use of .xs() for DataFrame views, not copies
  - DateTime indices named "Epoch"
  - Proper inheritance from Base class for logging/units/constants
  
  **Agent Routing Optimization:**
  - Physics calculations → PhysicsValidator
  - DataFrame operations → DataFrameArchitect  
  - Plotting code → PlottingEngineer
  - Test files → TestEngineer
  - Complex tasks → UnifiedPlanCoordinator
  
  **Performance & Security:**
  - No unbounded operations (add -maxdepth to find commands)
  - Appropriate timeout values for physics calculations
  - Memory efficiency for large datasets
  - Input validation for file paths and commands
  
  **Testing Standards:**
  - Coverage ≥95% (enforced by hooks)
  - Physics constraint validation in tests
  - Numerical stability testing for edge cases
  - Integration with existing .claude/hooks system
  
  When suggesting improvements, consider:
  - SolarWindPy has ~50 files, 1-2 developers, 5-10 PRs/month
  - Favor simple, maintainable solutions over complex engineering
  - Leverage existing sophisticated .claude agent/hook ecosystem
  - Maintain scientific accuracy and numerical precision
  
  Be constructive and provide specific, actionable feedback with line references.
```

#### Additional Configuration Enhancements

**File Pattern Targeting** (add after line 30):
```yaml
# Only run detailed review for significant changes
- name: Check if substantial changes
  id: check_changes
  run: |
    FILES_CHANGED=$(git diff --name-only ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }} ${{ github.sha }} | wc -l)
    LINES_CHANGED=$(git diff --stat ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }} ${{ github.sha }} | tail -1 | awk '{print $4+$6}')
    echo "files_changed=$FILES_CHANGED" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    echo "lines_changed=$LINES_CHANGED" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    
    # Skip review for trivial changes
    if [ $FILES_CHANGED -lt 2 ] && [ $LINES_CHANGED -lt 20 ]; then
      echo "skip_review=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    else
      echo "skip_review=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    fi

# Conditional review execution
- name: Run Claude Code Review
  if: steps.check_changes.outputs.skip_review == 'false'
  uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  # ... rest of configuration
```

#### Physics-Specific Review Triggers

**Enhanced File-Based Triggering**:
```yaml
# Add physics-specific review intensity
- name: Determine Review Focus  
  id: review_focus
  run: |
    PHYSICS_FILES=$(git diff --name-only ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }} ${{ github.sha }} | grep -E "(instabilities|core)" | wc -l)
    PLOTTING_FILES=$(git diff --name-only ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }} ${{ github.sha }} | grep "plotting" | wc -l)
    TEST_FILES=$(git diff --name-only ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }} ${{ github.sha }} | grep "tests/" | wc -l)
    
    if [ $PHYSICS_FILES -gt 0 ]; then
      echo "Extra focus on physics validation, unit consistency, and numerical accuracy." >> physics_focus.txt
    fi
    if [ $PLOTTING_FILES -gt 0 ]; then
      echo "Extra focus on matplotlib best practices and publication-quality output." >> plotting_focus.txt  
    fi
    if [ $TEST_FILES -gt 0 ]; then
      echo "Extra focus on test coverage ≥95% and physics constraint validation." >> testing_focus.txt
    fi
```

### Task 3.2: Create Quick Reference Documentation (Optional)
**Priority**: LOW (Nice-to-have for context)

**New File**: `.claude/docs/review-guidelines.md` (if time permits)

```markdown

   - Verify physics-specific prompts are included
   - Confirm agent routing suggestions appear

3. **Change Detection**:
   - Test with trivial changes (skip review)
   - Test with substantial changes (full review)
   - Test with physics-specific changes (enhanced prompts)

### Review Quality Assessment
1. **Physics Focus**:
   - Submit PR with unit inconsistency

3. **Triggers**: Remove file-based review intensity logic

## Success Metrics
- **Review Quality**: More physics-specific, actionable feedback
