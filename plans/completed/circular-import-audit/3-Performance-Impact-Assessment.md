# Phase 3: Performance Impact Assessment

**Estimated Duration**: 2 hours

## Overview
This phase focuses on measuring and analyzing the performance impact of the current import structure, identifying bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Measure import performance (Est: 1 hour)
- [ ] **Benchmark package import times and identify slow imports**
  - Create benchmarking framework for import performance
  - Measure import times for individual modules and subpackages
  - Identify slowest importing modules and root causes
  - Test import performance in different Python environments
  - Establish baseline metrics for optimization targets
  - Generate performance profile reports
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending

### Task 2: Profile memory usage during imports (Est: 1 hour)
- [ ] **Analyze memory consumption patterns during package initialization**
  - Implement memory profiling for import operations
  - Track memory allocation during module loading
  - Identify modules with high memory overhead during import
  - Analyze memory usage patterns and potential leaks
  - Document memory consumption baselines
  - Create memory usage visualization and reports
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending

## Deliverables
- Import performance benchmarking suite
- Performance baseline measurements and reports
- Memory profiling results and analysis
- Identification of performance bottlenecks
- Recommendations for performance optimization
- Automated performance testing framework

## Success Criteria
- Complete performance profile of all SolarWindPy imports
- Baseline metrics established for import times and memory usage
- Performance bottlenecks identified and documented
- Clear optimization targets and priorities defined
- Automated tools ready for monitoring performance improvements

## Technical Notes
- Use `time.perf_counter()` for high-precision timing measurements
- Leverage `memory_profiler` or `tracemalloc` for memory analysis
- Consider cold vs. warm import performance characteristics
- Account for Python bytecode compilation overhead
- Test across different Python versions if applicable
