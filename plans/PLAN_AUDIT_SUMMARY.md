### üöß Active/In-Progress Plans (6 total)

#### High Priority Plans
1. **deployment-semver-pypi-rtd** - üìç Branch: `plan/deployment-semver-pypi-rtd`
   - Status: In Progress (0/4 phases, 0/32 tasks)
   - Focus: PyPI deployment, semantic versioning, ReadTheDocs
   - Estimated: 8-12 hours

2. **pr-review-remediation** - üìç Branch: `plan/pr-review-remediation`
   - Status: Planning (0/3 phases, 0/12 tasks)
   - Focus: Security improvements, performance optimization
   - Estimated: 3.5 hours

3. **documentation-rendering-fixes** - üìç Branch: `plan/documentation-rendering-fixes`
   - Status: Planning (0/6 phases, 0/25 tasks)
   - Focus: Fix Sphinx build warnings, HTML rendering issues
   - Estimated: 11.5 hours
   - **Action**: Migrated from `solarwindpy/plans/` to root `plans/`

#### Lower Priority Plans
4. **session-continuity-protocol** - üìç Directory: `plans/session-continuity-protocol/`
   - Status: Planning (0/4 phases)
   - Focus: Session management and context switching prevention

#### Archive Candidates
5. **session-compaction-2025-08-12** - Compacted session state (outdated)
6. **session-compaction-2025-08-13** - Compacted session state (outdated)

### üßπ Cleanup Actions Performed

#### Plan Migrations
- **documentation-rendering-fixes**: Migrated from `solarwindpy/plans/` to root `plans/`
  - Complete 6-phase plan (810 lines) addressing Sphinx build warnings
  - All phase files migrated successfully
  - Removed duplicate nested directories

#### Branch Analysis
- **plan/documentation-rendering-fixes**: Contains valid plan content, now properly migrated
- **plan/fitfunctions-testing**: Orphan branch (no plan directory) - needs investigation
- All other plan branches have corresponding directories

#### Discovered Issues
- **Misplaced plans**: Found additional plans in `solarwindpy/plans/` that need migration
- **Duplicate plans**: Some plans exist in both abandoned and solarwindpy directories
- **Orphan branches**: Branches without corresponding plan directories

## Next Actions Required

### Immediate Priority
1. **Complete migration audit**: Check remaining plans in `solarwindpy/plans/`
2. **Archive old sessions**: Move session-compaction plans to archive
3. **Clean orphan branches**: Investigate plan/fitfunctions-testing branch

### Development Priority
1. **deployment-semver-pypi-rtd**: Critical for package distribution
2. **pr-review-remediation**: High ROI security improvements  
3. **documentation-rendering-fixes**: Addresses critical documentation issues

## Statistics
- **Total plans tracked**: 23 unique plans
- **Completion rate**: 65% (15/23)
- **Abandonment rate**: 9% (2/23)
- **Active development**: 26% (6/23)

## Migration Notes
- Successfully preserved all plan content during migration
- Maintained commit history and branch associations
- No data loss during cleanup operations
- All plan metadata and phase files intact
