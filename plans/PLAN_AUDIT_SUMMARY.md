- plan/github-issues-migration (active development, recent commits)

**📋 Feature branches identified**: 1 active
- feature/documentation-rendering-fixes (6 days ago, unmerged to plan branch)

#### Migration Analysis
- **✅ No solarwindpy/plans/ directory found** - no migration needed
- **✅ documentation-rendering-fixes**: Already migrated to root `plans/`
- **✅ All plan content properly organized** in plans/ hierarchy

## Next Actions Required

### Immediate Priority
1. **Investigate orphaned branch**:
   - `feature/git-integration-agent` - determine if obsolete (only true orphan)
2. **Archive old sessions**: Move session-compaction plans to archive
3. **Clean orphan branches**: Investigate plan/fitfunctions-testing branch
4. **Continue active development**: All 3 high-priority plans have directories ready

### Development Priority
1. **deployment-semver-pypi-rtd**: Critical for package distribution
2. **documentation-rendering-fixes**: Addresses critical documentation issues

## Statistics
- **Total plans tracked**: 27 unique plans
- **Completion rate**: 59% (16/27)
- **Abandonment rate**: 11% (3/27)
- **Active development**: 11% (3/27)
- **Plans requiring verification**: 19% (5/27)
- **Branch-specific plans**: 2 plans (deployment-semver-pypi-rtd, github-issues-migration)
- **Repository health**: Good - active plans properly documented, over-engineering eliminated

## Recently Completed
### pr-review-remediation (Completed 2025-08-19)
- **Duration**: 2 hours actual vs 3.5 hours estimated (43% under budget)
- **Deliverables**: 5 critical security fixes + PR workflow validation
- **Impact**: DoS prevention, command injection protection, adaptive timeouts
- **Files Modified**: 6 files, 300+ lines added
- **ROI**: HIGH - Prevents multiple attack vectors automatically

## Migration Notes
- Successfully preserved all plan content during migration
- Maintained commit history and branch associations
- No data loss during cleanup operations
- All plan metadata and phase files intact
