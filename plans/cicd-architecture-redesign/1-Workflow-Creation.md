# Phase 1: Workflow Creation

## Overview
Create the two new GitHub Actions workflows that will replace the broken ci.yml and publish.yml files with clean, maintainable alternatives.

## Objectives
- Create `release-pipeline.yml` for version tag deployments
- Create `continuous-integration.yml` for PR validation
- Implement tag detection logic with RC identification
- Configure progressive deployment stages
- Avoid complex YAML patterns that caused original failures

## Tasks

### Task 1.1: Create release-pipeline.yml (40 minutes)
**Implementation Steps:**
```bash
# Create the new release pipeline workflow
touch .github/workflows/release-pipeline.yml
```

**Workflow Requirements:**
- **Trigger**: Version tags (v*) on master branch
- **Flow**: Tag Detection → Quality Checks → Release Branch → TestPyPI → [PyPI if not RC] → [Conda if not RC]
- **Features**:
  - Intelligent version detection (RC vs production)
  - Progressive deployment with validation gates
  - Release branch creation for audit trail
  - No complex conditionals or inline comments

**Quality Checks Matrix:**
- 3 Operating Systems: Ubuntu, macOS, Windows
- 4 Python versions: 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- Total: 12 test combinations

**Deployment Stages:**
1. Always deploy to TestPyPI
2. Deploy to PyPI only if not RC
3. Create GitHub Release only if not RC
4. Open conda-forge issue only if not RC

### Task 1.2: Create continuous-integration.yml (20 minutes)
**Implementation Steps:**
```bash
# Create the new CI workflow for PRs
touch .github/workflows/continuous-integration.yml
```

**Workflow Requirements:**
- **Trigger**: Pull requests and non-master branches
- **Flow**: Quick tests with Python 3.12 on Ubuntu
- **Purpose**: Lightweight PR validation
- **Features**:
  - Single platform testing for speed
  - Essential quality checks only
  - No deployment logic

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `release-pipeline.yml` created with complete deployment logic
- [ ] `continuous-integration.yml` created with PR validation
- [ ] Both workflows use clean YAML without inline comments
- [ ] Tag detection logic correctly identifies RC vs production
- [ ] Progressive deployment configured with proper conditionals
- [ ] Quality checks matrix covers all supported platforms
- [ ] Workflows validate syntax when committed

## Risk Mitigation
- **YAML Parsing**: Avoid comments inside literal blocks that broke original workflows
- **Parallel Operation**: New workflows coexist with broken ones during testing
- **Validation**: Syntax check workflows before committing
- **Rollback**: Keep old workflows until new ones proven functional

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Task 1.1: release-pipeline.yml created and configured
- [x] Task 1.2: continuous-integration.yml created and configured
- [x] Both workflows committed to feature branch (commit: 0c646c5)
- [x] Syntax validation passed
- [x] Ready for Phase 2: Version Detection Configuration

## Implementation Checksum
**Commit**: `0c646c5` - feat: implement Phase 1 - create new CI/CD workflows
**Files Created**:
- `.github/workflows/release-pipeline.yml` (433 lines)
- `.github/workflows/continuous-integration.yml` (150 lines)

## Phase 1 Completion Notes
- Created clean, linear workflow architecture bypassing GitHub cache issues
- Implemented progressive deployment: TestPyPI → PyPI → GitHub Release
- RC detection logic prevents production deployments for release candidates
- Quality validation matrix covers 3 operating systems and 4 Python versions
- Lightweight PR validation with extended testing for plan branches
- No complex YAML patterns or inline comments that could break parsing

## Time Estimate
**Total: 1 hour**
- Task 1.1: 40 minutes
- Task 1.2: 20 minutes

## Notes
- These workflows completely bypass the GitHub cache corruption issue by using new file names
- Clean linear flow design makes debugging easier
- No complex YAML patterns that could break GitHub Actions parser
- Foundation for reliable PyPI deployment process
