## üéØ Objective
Complete redesign of GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows to bypass cache corruption and enable reliable PyPI/TestPyPI deployments for SolarWindPy v0.1.0.

## üß† Context
- **ci.yml** and **publish.yml** workflows failing with 0-second duration
- Root cause: Comments inside YAML literal block scalars breaking GitHub Actions parser
- GitHub cache corruption preventing workflow execution
- Blocking v0.1.0 release to PyPI/TestPyPI

## üîß Technical Requirements
- GitHub Actions workflows
- PyPI and TestPyPI API tokens (already configured)
- Python 3.8-3.12 compatibility
- Multi-platform testing (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
- setuptools_scm for version detection

## üìÇ Affected Areas
- .github/workflows/ (complete replacement)
- CLAUDE.md (workflow documentation updates)
- RELEASE.md (new deployment procedures)

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All phases completed successfully
- [ ] RC tags deploy to TestPyPI only (v0.1.0-rc5 test)
- [ ] Production tags deploy to both TestPyPI and PyPI (v0.1.0)
- [ ] GitHub Actions duration > 0 seconds (no parser failures)
- [ ] Release branches created for audit trail
- [ ] Old broken workflows removed
- [ ] Documentation updated

## üß™ Testing Strategy
- Test with v0.1.0-rc5 tag (TestPyPI only)
- Validate package installation from TestPyPI
- Deploy v0.1.0 tag (full pipeline)
- Verify PyPI package availability
- Confirm conda-forge automation triggers

- **Time Invested**: 2h of 6.5h
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-25

### Implementation Notes
- **Phases 1-3 Complete (0c646c5)**: Comprehensive workflow architecture implemented
- **Phase 1**: release-pipeline.yml and continuous-integration.yml created with clean architecture
- **Phase 2**: Version detection logic implemented with RC pattern `-rc[0-9]+$` plus alpha/beta support
- **Phase 3**: Deployment gates configured with progressive flow: TestPyPI ‚Üí PyPI ‚Üí GitHub Release ‚Üí Conda-Forge
- All deployment conditionals properly reference `needs.version-analysis.outputs.is_rc == 'false'`
- Quality validation matrix: 3 OS √ó 4 Python versions = 12 test combinations
- Ready to proceed with Phase 4: Release Candidate Testing (v0.1.0-rc5)

## üîó Related Plans
None

## üí¨ Notes & Considerations
- This plan completely replaces the broken ci.yml and publish.yml workflows
- The new architecture is simpler, more maintainable, and more reliable
- Release candidate strategy ensures safe testing before production deployments
- The approach has been validated against GitHub Actions best practices and documentation
