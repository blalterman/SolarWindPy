### Final Audit Completion
**âš¡ PLAN COMPLETE**: After committing Phase 6, **prompt user for final compaction and closeout**:
```
Phase 6 (Audit Deliverables) and the complete Physics-Focused Test Suite Audit 
are now finished! All 6 phases completed with atomic git commits.

Final step: Please run `/compact` to preserve the completed audit state, then 
proceed to 7-Closeout.md for plan archival and lessons learned documentation.

ðŸŽ‰ AUDIT SUCCESS: Test coverage improved from 77.1% to â‰¥95% with comprehensive 
physics validation, architecture compliance, and numerical stability enhancements!
```
