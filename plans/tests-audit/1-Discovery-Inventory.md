# Phase 1: Discovery & Inventory

## Phase Metadata
- **Phase**: 1/6
- **Estimated Duration**: 2-3 hours
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase Objective
Systematically discover, enumerate, and classify all 1,132 test functions across 63 test files in the SolarWindPy test suite. Create comprehensive inventory artifacts (TEST_INVENTORY.csv and TEST_INVENTORY.md) with detailed classification, metadata, and preparation for subsequent audit phases.

## ðŸ§  Phase Context
This foundational phase establishes the complete baseline for the test suite audit. The inventory will:
- Provide accurate test count verification (targeting 1,132 functions across 63 files)
- Enable systematic classification for targeted improvements
- Identify test coverage gaps and patterns
- Support agent coordination for specialized audit work
- Create structured artifacts for cross-phase tracking

## âœ… Phase Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All 63 test files discovered and catalogued
- [x] All 1,132 test functions enumerated with metadata
- [x] Test classification completed (unit, physics, edge, integration, performance)
- [x] Physics domain mapping established for core modules
- [x] Current coverage baseline documented (77.1%)
- [x] Coverage gaps identified with ~200 test estimate for â‰¥95% target
- [x] TEST_INVENTORY.csv generated with complete metadata
- [x] TEST_INVENTORY.md created with summary analysis
- [x] Inventory artifacts validated for accuracy and completeness
- [x] TestEngineer agent coordination documented for Phase 2 handoff

## ðŸ§ª Phase Testing Strategy
- **Inventory Validation**: Cross-check discovered tests against pytest --collect-only output
- **Classification Accuracy**: Spot-check test classifications using function analysis
- **Artifact Integrity**: Validate CSV/MD artifacts contain all discovered tests
- **Coverage Baseline**: Confirm coverage report matches documented 77.1% baseline

## ðŸ”§ Phase Technical Requirements
- **Dependencies**: pytest, pytest-cov, pandas (for CSV generation), Python AST parsing
- **Environment**: SolarWindPy development environment with all test dependencies
- **Constraints**: Must maintain existing test functionality during discovery
- **Tools**: find, grep, Python AST, pytest collection utilities

## ðŸ“‚ Phase Affected Areas
- `tests/` - Read-only analysis of all test files
- `plans/tests-audit/artifacts/` - Create inventory artifacts directory
- `plans/tests-audit/` - Update phase documentation with progress
- Coverage reports and baseline documentation

## ðŸ“Š Phase Progress Tracking
