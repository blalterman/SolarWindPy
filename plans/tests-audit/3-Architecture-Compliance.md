# Phase 3: Architecture Compliance

## Phase Metadata
- **Phase**: 3/6
- **Estimated Duration**: 2-3 hours
- **Dependencies**: Phase 1 (test inventory), Phase 2 (physics validation baseline)
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase Objective
Validate test suite compliance with SolarWindPy's hierarchical MultiIndex DataFrame architecture using the DataFrameArchitect agent. Ensure all tests properly use the three-level MultiIndex structure ("M", "C", "S"), validate .xs() usage for DataFrame views, and verify proper handling of measurement types, components, and species indexing patterns.

## ðŸ§  Phase Context
SolarWindPy's core architecture relies on hierarchical pandas DataFrames with MultiIndex columns:
- **M**: Measurement type (n, v, w, b, etc.)
- **C**: Component (x, y, z for vectors, empty for scalars)
- **S**: Species (p1, p2, a, etc., empty for magnetic field)

This phase ensures all tests properly validate this architecture and identify tests that may not be exercising the MultiIndex patterns correctly.

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Tasks
