## Phase Metadata
- **Phase**: 5/6
- **Estimated Duration**: 2-3 hours
- **Dependencies**: Phase 1-4 completed (inventory, physics, architecture, stability analysis)
- **Status**: Not Started

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase Objective
Systematically enhance test documentation by adding comprehensive YAML doc blocks to all 1,132 test functions, improving test naming conventions, adding inline physics comments, and creating a comprehensive test documentation standard that supports maintainability and scientific understanding.
