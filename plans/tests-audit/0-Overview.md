## üéØ Objective
Conduct a comprehensive audit of SolarWindPy's test suite to improve physics validation, architectural compliance, numerical stability, and documentation. Transform the current 63 test files with 1,132 test functions into a scientifically rigorous and well-documented testing framework that achieves ‚â•95% coverage and validates all physics constraints.

## üß† Context
SolarWindPy currently has 77.1% test coverage across 63 test files containing 1,132 test functions. The test suite needs systematic improvement to ensure:
- Physics constraint validation (SI units, thermal speed conventions, conservation laws)
- Proper MultiIndex DataFrame architecture compliance
- Numerical stability for edge cases (B‚âà0, n‚Üí0, extreme temperatures)
- Comprehensive documentation with YAML doc blocks
- Systematic coverage improvement to reach ‚â•95% target

This audit will leverage specialized agents (TestEngineer, PhysicsValidator, DataFrameArchitect, NumericalStabilityGuard) to ensure scientific rigor and maintain SolarWindPy's physics accuracy standards.

## üîß Technical Requirements
- Python 3.9+ with pytest framework
- Specialized Claude agents for domain expertise
- Git workflow with atomic phase commits
- State compaction system for session continuity
- Hook-based automation for physics validation
- YAML documentation integration
- Coverage analysis tools (pytest-cov, coverage.py)

## üìÇ Affected Areas
- `tests/` - All 63 test files requiring audit and enhancement
- `.claude/artifacts/tests-audit/` - Audit deliverables and reports
- Test documentation and naming conventions
- Coverage configuration and reporting
- Physics validation test patterns

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 6 phases completed successfully
- [ ] Test coverage improved from 77.1% to ‚â•95%
- [ ] All 1,132 test functions documented with YAML blocks
- [ ] Physics validation tests added for all core calculations
- [ ] Numerical stability tests for edge cases implemented
- [ ] Architecture compliance verified for MultiIndex patterns
- [ ] Audit deliverables generated and archived
- [ ] Git history maintains atomic phase commits
- [ ] Agent coordination documented for future maintenance

## üß™ Testing Strategy
Systematic validation across six specialized domains:
1. **Inventory Testing**: Automated enumeration and classification
2. **Physics Testing**: PhysicsValidator agent for constraint verification
3. **Architecture Testing**: DataFrameArchitect agent for MultiIndex compliance
4. **Stability Testing**: NumericalStabilityGuard agent for edge case handling
5. **Documentation Testing**: YAML block validation and completeness
6. **Integration Testing**: Cross-phase validation and artifact generation
