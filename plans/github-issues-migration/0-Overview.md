## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Migrate SolarWindPy's local plans system to GitHub Issues while preserving the comprehensive propositions framework (Risk, Value, Cost, Token, Usage), automatic closeout documentation (85% implementation decision capture), and velocity learning capabilities.

## ðŸ§  Context
The current local plans system in `plans/` directories provides excellent structured planning with detailed propositions analysis and automatic closeout documentation. However, it creates token overhead (~105K per session) and lacks the collaborative features, search capabilities, and CI/CD integration that GitHub Issues provide. This migration aims to preserve all current capabilities while gaining GitHub's native features.

**Key Requirements:**
- Preserve 85% automatic closeout documentation capture
- Maintain comprehensive propositions framework
- Support velocity learning and metrics tracking
- Zero data loss during migration
- Single "plan:phase" label system (not plan:phase-1, plan:phase-2)
- Complete rewrite of issues_from_plans.py (not update)
- 46 total labels for comprehensive categorization

## ðŸ“ˆ Plan Propositions

### Risk Proposition
**Technical Risks**:
- HIGH: Propositions framework complexity - GitHub markdown limitations may constrain rich metadata
- MEDIUM: API rate limits during bulk migration (5000 requests/hour for authenticated users)
- MEDIUM: Loss of local file-based workflow and offline capabilities
- MEDIUM: Integration complexity with existing .claude/hooks/ validation system

**Scientific Risks**:
- HIGH: Knowledge transfer risk - 85% implementation decision capture must be preserved
- MEDIUM: Velocity learning data migration complexity and historical metrics preservation
- LOW: Physics validation workflow integration with GitHub-native issue tracking

**Operational Risks**:
- HIGH: Team adoption risk - significant workflow change requiring training and habit modification
- MEDIUM: Search workflow changes - GitHub search vs local file grep patterns
- MEDIUM: Backup and disaster recovery procedures need complete redesign
- LOW: Performance impact during large-scale operations (100+ issues)

**Risk Mitigation Strategies**:
- Parallel system operation during transition (local plans preserved)
- Comprehensive automated validation of propositions preservation
- Staged rollout with pilot projects before full migration
- Complete backup procedures and rollback plans documented
- GitHub API wrapper with rate limiting and retry logic

### Value Proposition
**Scientific Value**:
- HIGH: Enhanced collaboration - 85% implementation decision preservation with web-native access
- HIGH: Improved knowledge transfer through searchable, linkable decision history
- MEDIUM: Better grant reporting through structured, timestamped development progress
- MEDIUM: Enhanced reproducibility through GitHub's audit trail and version control

**Developer Value**:
- HIGH: 75-85% token reduction per session (105K â†’ 20K average)
- HIGH: Zero local maintenance overhead - GitHub handles infrastructure
- HIGH: Native CI/CD integration with plan validation and automated workflows
- MEDIUM: Enhanced cross-team visibility and contribution opportunities
- MEDIUM: Better priority management through GitHub's native sorting and filtering

**User Value**:
- HIGH: Instant search across all plans, phases, and implementation history
- HIGH: Web interface access from any device without local repository setup
- MEDIUM: Real-time notifications and collaboration features
- MEDIUM: Integration with GitHub's ecosystem (projects, milestones, discussions)
- LOW: Public visibility enabling community contributions (if desired)

**ROI Timeline**:
- Immediate (0-1 weeks): Token savings and reduced session overhead
- Medium-term (1-3 months): Enhanced collaboration and improved planning velocity
- Long-term (6+ months): Knowledge base accumulation and institutional memory preservation

### Cost Proposition
**Development Time**:
- 24-32 hours total implementation across 5 phases
- High confidence interval (Â±4 hours) due to well-defined scope
- Complexity factors: GitHub API integration (1.2x), propositions preservation (1.4x)

**Review & Testing Time**:
- 5-8 hours comprehensive validation including migration testing
- 2-3 hours peer review and team feedback integration
- 1-2 hours final validation with real plan migration

**Maintenance Cost**:
- SAVINGS: 120-180 hours/year eliminated (10-15 hours/month local system maintenance)
- ANNUAL: ~2-4 hours GitHub integration updates and label management
- ONE-TIME: 4-6 hours team training and workflow transition

**Opportunity Cost**:
- One week development time deferred from other high-priority work
- UI improvements and user-facing features delayed by 1-2 sprints
- OFFSET: Maintenance savings recover investment in 2-3 months

### Token Proposition
**Planning Tokens**:
- 33,000 tokens for comprehensive plan design and propositions analysis
- 8,000 tokens for cross-system dependency analysis and risk assessment
- 5,000 tokens for migration strategy validation and rollback planning

**Implementation Tokens**:
- 70,000 tokens for PropositionsAwareMigrator development and testing
- 15,000 tokens for GitHub issue templates and label system creation
- 12,000 tokens for CLI integration and automation workflow setup
- 8,000 tokens for comprehensive validation and migration testing

**Future Token Savings**:
- 85,000 tokens per session saved (105K â†’ 20K average)
- 25,000 tokens per month saved through reduced planning overhead
- 15,000 tokens quarterly saved through automated status tracking

**Net Token ROI**:
- Break-even point: 2 development sessions post-migration
- Annual savings: 20.4M tokens (240 sessions Ã— 85K savings)
- 5-year ROI: 102M tokens saved after 153K investment
