## 🎯 Objective
Create a new GitHub Issues-based plan management system for SolarWindPy that preserves the comprehensive propositions framework (Risk, Value, Cost, Token, Usage) and automatic closeout documentation (85% implementation decision capture). Primary objective: Enable instant plan synchronization across 3 development computers for future plans, eliminating cross-machine friction while maintaining all sophisticated planning capabilities in a GitHub-native workflow.

## 🧠 Context
The current local plans system in `plans/` directories provides excellent structured planning with detailed propositions analysis and automatic closeout documentation. However, plans become trapped on local branches across multiple development machines, creating significant cross-computer friction for future work. With 3 active development computers, the inability to instantly access and collaborate on plans from any machine limits development efficiency for complex scientific projects.

Rather than migrate existing plans (which remain as historical reference), this system creates a GitHub Issues-based workflow for new plans, providing instant multi-computer access while preserving all sophisticated planning capabilities.

**Key Requirements:**
- Preserve 85% automatic closeout documentation capture in GitHub Issues format
- Maintain comprehensive propositions framework via issue templates
- Zero risk approach - coexist with existing local plans system
- Single "plan:phase" label system (not plan:phase-1, plan:phase-2)  
- 25 total labels for comprehensive scientific project categorization
- Multi-computer synchronization as primary value driver
- Integration with existing .claude/agents/ and .claude/hooks/ systems

## 🔧 Technical Requirements
**Core Dependencies**:
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) for automation and scripting
- Python 3.8+ for agent extension and hook development
- GitHub API access with repository admin permissions
- Existing `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/hooks/` integration

**GitHub Features**:
- Issue templates with YAML frontmatter for propositions framework
- Labels system supporting hierarchical categorization (25 labels)
- Milestones for phase-based progress tracking
- Cross-issue linking for multi-phase plan coordination

**Integration Points**:
- UnifiedPlanCoordinator agent extension for GitHub Issues support
- `.claude/hooks/` system adaptation for issue creation workflows
- CLAUDE.md documentation updates for new GitHub Issues workflow
- Direct GitHub Issues to feature branch workflow

## 📂 Affected Areas

---
*This multi-phase plan implements directly on feature/github-issues-migration branch with progress tracked via commit checksums in phase files. Each phase concludes with a milestone commit that captures all deliverables and updates progress tracking before proceeding to the next phase.*

## 🔄 Context Management Strategy

**Real Context Preservation**: This plan uses git commits and plan file updates as the primary context preservation mechanism, not in-session compaction:

### How Context Actually Works
1. **Git Milestone Commits**: Each phase ends with a commit capturing all deliverables and progress
2. **Plan File Updates**: Implementation decisions and progress tracked in phase files
3. **Session Breaks**: Natural boundaries where users can end/resume sessions cleanly
4. **File-Based Context**: When resuming, Claude reads plan files and git history for full context

### User Session Management
**Between Phases**: User controls session boundaries and transitions:

```markdown
## Session Transition Process:
1. Complete phase milestone git commit
2. Update plan files with progress and decisions  
3. End Claude Code session naturally
4. Resume: Start new session with: "Continue GitHub Issues migration plan - begin Phase [N+1]. Read current status from plans/github-issues-migration/ directory."
```

### Why This Works
- **Git commits** preserve exact state of deliverables
- **Plan files** contain all implementation decisions and next steps
- **Claude Code** automatically handles token limits during individual sessions
- **File reading** provides complete context for seamless continuation

**Important**: Claude cannot execute user interface commands like `/compact`. Context preservation is handled through version control and structured plan documentation.
