## 🎯 Objective
Migrate SolarWindPy's local plans system to GitHub Issues while preserving the comprehensive propositions framework (Risk, Value, Cost, Token, Usage) and automatic closeout documentation (85% implementation decision capture). Primary objective: Enable instant plan synchronization across 3 development computers, eliminating 100+ hours/year lost to cross-machine friction and preventing data loss from local-only plan branches.

## 🧠 Context
The current local plans system in `plans/` directories provides excellent structured planning with detailed propositions analysis and automatic closeout documentation. However, plans become trapped on local branches across multiple development machines, creating significant cross-computer friction and risk of data loss. With 3 active development computers, the inability to instantly sync and access plans from any machine wastes 100+ hours annually in context switching overhead, branch management, and duplicated work. This migration aims to preserve all current capabilities while enabling instant multi-computer synchronization through GitHub's native features.

**Key Requirements:**
- Preserve 85% automatic closeout documentation capture
- Maintain comprehensive propositions framework
- Zero data loss during migration
- Single "plan:phase" label system (not plan:phase-1, plan:phase-2)
- Complete rewrite of issues_from_plans.py (not update)
- 20-25 total labels for practical categorization
- Multi-computer synchronization as primary value driver

## 🔧 Technical Requirements
**Core Dependencies**:
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) for automation and scripting
- Python 3.8+ with `requests`, `pyyaml`, `click` for migration tools
- GitHub API access with repository admin permissions
- Existing `.claude/hooks/` integration for validation workflows

**GitHub Features**:
- Issue templates with YAML frontmatter for structured data
- Labels system supporting hierarchical categorization
- Milestones for phase-based progress tracking
- GitHub Actions for automated validation and workflow enforcement

**Integration Points**:
- `.claude/hooks/` validation system adaptation for GitHub Issues
- CLAUDE.md documentation updates for new workflow
- Git branch workflow coordination with issue lifecycle
- Velocity tracking system migration from local files to GitHub metadata

## 📂 Affected Areas
**Direct Modifications**:
- `plans/issues_from_plans.py` → Complete rewrite as PropositionsAwareMigrator
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` → New issue templates (overview, phase, closeout)
- `.claude/hooks/` → GitHub integration scripts replacing Python hooks
- `.claude/scripts/` → New migration and validation utilities

**Data Migration**:
- `plans/*` directories → GitHub Issues with preserved metadata
- Velocity metrics → GitHub issue metadata and external tracking
- Implementation decisions → GitHub issue comments and close documentation
- Cross-plan dependencies → GitHub issue links and milestone coordination

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 5 phases completed successfully with full validation
- [ ] 20-25 GitHub labels created and organized in 5 essential categories
