### Performance Outcomes
*Actual performance metrics will be documented here during implementation*

## üéØ Acceptance Criteria Results

### Core Requirements
- [ ] All 20-25 GitHub labels created and organized in 5 essential categories
- [ ] 3 issue templates supporting complete propositions framework
- [ ] PropositionsAwareMigrator replaces issues_from_plans.py with 100% feature parity
- [ ] Zero data loss validated through comprehensive migration testing
- [ ] 85% implementation decision capture preserved in GitHub format
- [ ] Completed and abandoned plans migrated with full metadata preservation

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] All tests pass and code coverage maintained ‚â• 95%
- [ ] Team trained and comfortable with new GitHub-native workflow
- [ ] Documentation updated and comprehensive migration guide available
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented and tested

### Technical Validation
- [ ] GitHub CLI integration functional and performant
- [ ] Automation workflows (labeling, linking, notifications) operational
- [ ] Cross-plan dependency tracking preserved through GitHub issue links
- [ ] Security assessment confirmed code-level only (no FAIR compliance required)

## üß† Implementation Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
*Key architectural and design decisions made during implementation will be captured here*

### Scope Boundary Decisions
- **Security Scope**: Confirmed code-level security only, NO FAIR data principle compliance
- **SolarWindPy Alignment**: 24/100 alignment score acceptable for infrastructure tooling
- **Label System**: Final count of 20-25 labels provides practical single-developer categorization
- **Context Management**: Manual user compaction after each Task Group prevents token limits

### Alternative Approaches Considered
*Alternative implementations evaluated and rejected during development*

## üîÑ Context Management Implementation

### Manual Compaction Strategy
- **Implementation**: Added context management points after each Task Group in all 5 phases
- **User Responsibility**: Manual conversation compaction to prevent token limit issues
- **Process**: Save progress ‚Üí start fresh session ‚Üí continue with next Task Group
- **Effectiveness**: *To be measured during extended implementation sessions*

### Token Usage Optimization
- **Planning Token Reduction**: Manual planning ~1900 tokens ‚Üí automated ~425 tokens (78% reduction)
- **Migration Token Efficiency**: Manual migration ~2000 tokens/plan ‚Üí CLI automation ~200 tokens/plan (90% reduction)
- **Session Extension**: Estimated 15-20 additional productive minutes per session
