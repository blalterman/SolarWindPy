## ðŸ§ª Phase Testing Strategy
**Documentation Validation**:
- Technical accuracy review of all updated documentation
- Workflow testing following documented procedures
- Link verification and example validation
- Cross-reference consistency across all documentation

**Training Material Testing**:
- Dry run of training presentation with feedback incorporation
- Hands-on exercise validation with real GitHub repository
- Video tutorial accuracy and clarity verification
- Onboarding checklist testing with new team member simulation

**Team Adoption Testing**:
- Workshop effectiveness measurement through participant feedback
- Post-training workflow competency assessment
- Real-world usage monitoring for first week post-training
- Support request tracking for common issues identification

## ðŸ”§ Phase Technical Requirements
**Documentation Platform**:
- Markdown editing capabilities for CLAUDE.md updates
- GitHub wiki or repository documentation hosting
- Video recording and editing tools for tutorials
- Presentation software for training materials

**Training Infrastructure**:
- Screen recording software for video tutorials
- Video hosting platform (GitHub, YouTube, internal)
- Interactive presentation tools for workshop delivery
- Practice GitHub repository for hands-on exercises

**Support Systems**:
- Communication channels for ongoing support (Slack, Discord)
- Feedback collection tools (forms, surveys)
- Issue tracking for documentation and workflow improvements
- Knowledge base for FAQ and troubleshooting accumulation

## ðŸ“‚ Phase Affected Areas
- `CLAUDE.md` - Complete workflow section updates
- Documentation repository - New guides and references
- Training materials - Presentations, videos, exercises
