# Phase 3: CLI Integration & Automation

## Phase Metadata
- **Phase**: 3/5
- **Estimated Duration**: 4-5 hours
- **Dependencies**: Phase 2 (PropositionsAwareMigrator)
- **Status**: Not Started

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase Objective
Integrate PropositionsAwareMigrator with GitHub CLI (`gh`) scripts, replace Python-based `.claude/hooks/` with shell scripts, and create automated workflows for plan lifecycle management in GitHub Issues.

## ðŸ§  Phase Context
This phase transforms the manual migration tool into an automated workflow system. The existing `.claude/hooks/` Python scripts need replacement with `gh` CLI-based shell scripts that integrate seamlessly with GitHub Issues while preserving all validation and automation capabilities.

- [ ] Plan creation, status, migration, and completion scripts fully functional
- [ ] Automated labeling system accurately categorizes plans across 46 labels
- [ ] Cross-plan dependency detection and conflict resolution automated
- [ ] Velocity tracking integration maintains historical data accuracy
- [ ] Git workflow validation seamlessly integrates GitHub Issues
- [ ] Performance meets or exceeds current Python-based hook system
- [ ] All automation workflows tested and validated with real scenarios
- [ ] Documentation updated for new CLI-based workflow
- [ ] Team training materials prepared for transition

## ðŸ§ª Phase Testing Strategy
**CLI Script Testing**:
- Individual script functionality validation
- Parameter passing and error handling testing
- GitHub API integration and authentication testing
- Progress reporting and user interaction validation

**Automation Workflow Testing**:
- Automated labeling accuracy across diverse plan content
- Cross-plan dependency detection with complex scenarios
- Velocity tracking data integrity and update accuracy
- Notification system reliability and appropriate triggering

**Integration Testing**:
- End-to-end plan lifecycle testing (create â†’ implement â†’ complete)
- Git workflow integration with GitHub Issues synchronization
- Performance comparison with existing Python-based system
- Error handling and recovery testing for various failure modes

## ðŸ”§ Phase Technical Requirements
**Core Dependencies**:
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) 2.0+ with full API support
- Bash 4.0+ for advanced shell scripting features
- `jq` for JSON processing and GitHub API response handling
- `curl` for direct API calls when gh CLI insufficient

**GitHub Integration**:
- Repository admin permissions for automated operations
- GitHub Actions workflow integration (optional)
- Webhook configuration for real-time synchronization
- API rate limit monitoring and management

**System Integration**:
- Existing `.claude/hooks/` directory structure preservation
- Git hook integration points maintained
- Session validation system compatibility
- Cross-platform shell script compatibility (macOS, Linux)

## ðŸ“‚ Phase Affected Areas
- `.claude/hooks/` - Replace Python scripts with gh CLI shell scripts
- `.claude/scripts/` - New CLI utilities and automation workflows
- Git hooks - Integration with GitHub Issues workflow
- Session validation - GitHub Issues context loading
- Team workflow - New CLI-based plan management procedures

## ðŸ“Š Phase Progress Tracking

### Current Status
- **Tasks Completed**: 0/14
- **Time Invested**: 0h of 4.5h estimated
- **Completion Percentage**: 0%
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-19

### Blockers & Issues
- Dependency: Phase 2 PropositionsAwareMigrator completion required
- Risk: GitHub CLI API coverage may require additional curl scripting
- Risk: Shell script complexity for advanced automation features

### Next Actions
- Begin with basic CLI scripts (create, status, migrate)
- Test GitHub CLI capabilities thoroughly before implementation
- Develop automation workflows incrementally with validation
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility throughout development

## ðŸ’¬ Phase Implementation Notes

### Implementation Decisions
- GitHub CLI chosen over direct API calls for maintainability and authentication
- Shell scripts preferred over Python for reduced dependencies and faster execution
- Modular script design enables incremental adoption and testing
- Automation workflows designed to be optional and configurable

### Lessons Learned
*Will be updated during implementation*

### Phase Dependencies Resolution
- Requires Phase 2 PropositionsAwareMigrator for migration functionality
- Provides automation foundation for Phase 4 validated migration
- Establishes CLI workflow for Phase 5 documentation and training
