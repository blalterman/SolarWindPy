# Phase 2: Migration Tool Complete Rewrite

## Phase Metadata
- **Phase**: 2/5
- **Estimated Duration**: 5-6 hours
- **Dependencies**: Phase 1 (labels and templates)
- **Status**: Not Started

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase Objective
Completely rewrite `plans/issues_from_plans.py` as `PropositionsAwareMigrator` class with comprehensive support for propositions framework preservation and closeout documentation migration.

## ðŸ§  Phase Context
The existing `issues_from_plans.py` is a basic script focused on simple YAML frontmatter. The new PropositionsAwareMigrator must handle the complete propositions framework, preserve 85% implementation decision capture, and focus on reliability over complex feature migration.

### Task Group 4 Propositions Analysis:

**Risk Assessment**: Medium complexity CLI may deter adoption; high error handling needs for API failures; comprehensive testing required for mock responses.

**Value Proposition**: 5x faster than web interface; scriptable workflows; batch processing; aligns with developer expectations.

**Cost Analysis**: 2.5 hours implementation + 1 hour testing + 30 min docs = 4 hours total; ~13 hours/year maintenance after Year 1.

**Token Optimization**: Manual migration ~2000 tokens/plan â†’ CLI automation ~200 tokens/plan (90% reduction).

**Usage Metrics**: 10 plans/hour throughput; <2% error rate target; 80% developer preference for CLI.

**Scope Alignment**: Score 20/100 (acceptable development tooling scope).
