# Phase 1: Foundation & Label System

## Phase Metadata
- **Phase**: 1/5
- **Estimated Duration**: 3-4 hours
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Status**: Not Started

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase Objective
Establish the foundational GitHub infrastructure including practical label system (20-25 labels across 5 essential categories), issue templates supporting propositions framework, and initial repository configuration for plan migration.

## ðŸ§  Phase Context
This phase creates the GitHub-native infrastructure required to support the full propositions framework and closeout documentation. The label system focuses on essential categorization for single-developer workflow while the issue templates preserve all current plan metadata and structure.

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Tasks

### Task Group 1: GitHub Labels System (20-25 labels)

  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Lifecycle tracking matching current plan statuses
- [ ] **Create type labels** (Est: 25 min) - type:feature, type:bugfix, type:refactor, type:docs, type:test, type:infrastructure, type:chore
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Work categorization for velocity tracking
- [ ] **Create plan structure labels** (Est: 15 min) - plan:overview, plan:phase, plan:closeout
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Single "plan:phase" label (not plan:phase-1, plan:phase-2)
- [ ] **Create domain labels** (Est: 35 min) - domain:physics, domain:data, domain:plotting, domain:testing, domain:infrastructure, domain:docs
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Scientific domain categorization for specialist routing

### ðŸ”„ Context Management Point
**IMPORTANT**: After completing this Task Group, the user should manually compact the conversation context to ensure continued development efficiency. This prevents token limit issues during extended implementation sessions.

To compact: Save current progress, start fresh session with compacted state, and continue with next Task Group.

### Task Group 2: Issue Templates Creation
- [ ] **Create overview template** (Est: 60 min) - .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/plan-overview.yml
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Complete propositions framework with YAML frontmatter
- [ ] **Create phase template** (Est: 45 min) - .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/plan-phase.yml
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Task tracking with checksum support and progress monitoring
- [ ] **Create closeout template** (Est: 30 min) - .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/plan-closeout.yml
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Implementation decisions capture (85% automation target)

### Task Group 3: Repository Configuration
- [ ] **Configure issue settings** (Est: 15 min) - Enable discussions, configure default labels
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Repository-level settings for optimal plan workflow
- [ ] **Create label documentation** (Est: 30 min) - Document label usage and categorization rules
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Team reference for consistent labeling practices
- [ ] **Validate template rendering** (Est: 20 min) - Test all templates with sample data
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Ensure propositions framework renders correctly

### Task Group 4: Initial Validation
- [ ] **Test label hierarchy** (Est: 25 min) - Verify label combinations and filtering work correctly
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Validate 20-25 label system usability
- [ ] **Create sample issues** (Est: 40 min) - Test overview, phase, and closeout templates
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: End-to-end validation of propositions preservation
- [ ] **Document GitHub CLI setup** (Est: 20 min) - Team setup instructions for gh CLI
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending
  - Notes: Required for automation workflows in later phases

## âœ… Phase Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 20-25 labels created and properly categorized across 5 essential groups
- [ ] 3 issue templates (overview, phase, closeout) render correctly
- [ ] Templates preserve complete propositions framework structure
- [ ] Sample issues demonstrate propositions metadata preservation
- [ ] Label combinations support complex filtering and search
- [ ] Repository configuration optimized for plan workflow
- [ ] Team documentation complete for label usage
- [ ] GitHub CLI setup validated and documented

## ðŸ§ª Phase Testing Strategy
**Template Validation**:
- Render all templates with comprehensive test data
- Verify propositions framework sections display correctly
- Test YAML frontmatter parsing and metadata extraction
- Validate markdown rendering across different GitHub views

**Label System Testing**:
- Test all 20-25 labels for correct categorization
- Verify color coding and visual distinction
- Test complex label combinations and filtering
- Validate search functionality across label hierarchies

**Integration Testing**:
- End-to-end issue creation with all templates
- Cross-template consistency validation
- GitHub API compatibility testing
- Mobile and web interface rendering verification

## ðŸ”§ Phase Technical Requirements
**GitHub Features**:
- Repository admin access for label and template creation
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) for automation and bulk operations
- YAML frontmatter support in issue templates
- Advanced label filtering and search capabilities

**Dependencies**:
- No external dependencies - GitHub-native features only
- Team GitHub accounts with appropriate repository permissions
- Browser access for template testing and validation

## ðŸ“‚ Phase Affected Areas
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` - New issue templates
- Repository labels - Complete 41-label system
- Repository settings - Issue and discussion configuration
- Team documentation - Label usage and workflow guides

## ðŸ“Š Phase Progress Tracking

### Current Status
- **Tasks Completed**: 0/12
- **Time Invested**: 0h of 3.5h estimated
- **Completion Percentage**: 0%
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-19

### Blockers & Issues
- No current blockers - foundational phase with clear requirements
- Risk: GitHub template complexity may require iteration
- Risk: Label system usability needs validation with real usage

### Next Actions
- Begin with priority and status labels as foundational categories
- Create overview template first as most complex template
- Validate each template immediately after creation
- Document label usage patterns for team consistency

## ðŸ’¬ Phase Implementation Notes

### Implementation Decisions
- Single "plan:phase" label chosen over numbered variants for simplicity
- 20-25 total labels provides practical categorization for single-developer workflow
- YAML frontmatter in templates enables structured metadata preservation
- Color-coded priority system follows GitHub conventional patterns

### Lessons Learned
*Will be updated during implementation*

### Phase Dependencies Resolution
- No dependencies - foundational phase creates infrastructure for subsequent phases
- Provides complete GitHub infrastructure for Phase 2 migration tool development
- Establishes template standards for Phase 3 CLI integration
