# Phase 1: Foundation & Label System

## Phase Metadata
- **Phase**: 1/5
- **Estimated Duration**: 3-4 hours
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Status**: Not Started

## 🎯 Phase Objective
Establish the foundational GitHub infrastructure including practical label system (20-25 labels across 5 essential categories), issue templates supporting propositions framework, and initial repository configuration for plan migration.

## 🧠 Phase Context
This phase creates the GitHub-native infrastructure required to support the full propositions framework and closeout documentation. The label system focuses on essential categorization for single-developer workflow while the issue templates preserve all current plan metadata and structure.

## 📊 Phase Progress Tracking

### Current Status
- **Tasks Completed**: 0/14
- **Time Invested**: 0h of 3.75h estimated
- **Completion Percentage**: 0%
- **Last Updated**: 2025-09-03

### Blockers & Issues
- No current blockers - foundational phase with clear requirements
- Risk: GitHub template complexity may require iteration
- Risk: Label system usability needs validation with real usage

### Next Actions
- Begin with priority and status labels as foundational categories
- Create overview template first as most complex template
- Validate each template immediately after creation
- Document label usage patterns for team consistency

## 💬 Phase Implementation Notes

### Implementation Decisions
- Single "plan:phase" label chosen over numbered variants for simplicity
- 20-25 total labels provides practical categorization for single-developer workflow
- YAML frontmatter in templates enables structured metadata preservation
- Color-coded priority system follows GitHub conventional patterns

### Lessons Learned
*Will be updated during implementation*

### Phase Dependencies Resolution
- No dependencies - foundational phase creates infrastructure for subsequent phases
- Provides complete GitHub infrastructure for Phase 2 plan creation system
- Establishes template standards for Phase 3 CLI integration
