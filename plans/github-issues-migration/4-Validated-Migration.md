# Phase 4: Validated Migration

## Phase Metadata
- **Phase**: 4/5
- **Estimated Duration**: 4-5 hours
- **Dependencies**: Phase 3 (CLI Integration & Automation)
- **Status**: Not Started

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase Objective
Execute comprehensive migration of existing plans to GitHub Issues with rigorous validation, zero data loss verification, and complete propositions framework preservation. Establish parallel system validation and rollback procedures.

## ðŸ§  Phase Context
This phase represents the critical transition from local plans to GitHub Issues. All existing plans must be migrated with 100% data preservation, including propositions framework, implementation decisions, velocity metrics, and cross-plan dependencies. Validation must confirm zero data loss before local system decommissioning.

- Risk: GitHub API rate limits may require staged migration approach

### Next Actions
- Complete comprehensive audit of all existing plans
- Execute small-scale test migration with detailed validation
- Develop rollback procedures before large-scale migration
- Coordinate with team for migration timing and communication

- Comprehensive backup procedures ensure zero risk of data loss
- Parallel system validation confirms migration accuracy
- Rollback procedures provide safety net for migration execution

### Lessons Learned
*Will be updated during implementation*

### Phase Dependencies Resolution
