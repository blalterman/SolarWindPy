# Phase 4: Validated Migration

## Phase Metadata
- **Phase**: 4/5
- **Estimated Duration**: 3-4 hours
- **Dependencies**: Phase 3 (CLI Integration & Automation)
- **Status**: Not Started

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase Objective
Execute selective migration of active and high-value completed plans to GitHub Issues with rigorous validation, zero data loss verification, and complete propositions framework preservation. Prioritize active plans for immediate multi-computer access.

## ðŸ§  Phase Context
This phase represents the selective transition from local plans to GitHub Issues. Active plans and select high-value completed plans will be migrated with 100% data preservation of propositions framework, implementation decisions, and cross-plan dependencies. Focus on enabling immediate multi-computer access over comprehensive historical migration.

### Completed/Abandoned Plans Migration Analysis:

**Risk Assessment**: Low data loss (read-only archives), Medium metadata reconstruction needs, High API rate limits for bulk operations.

**Value Proposition**: Knowledge preservation, GitHub superior search, cross-referencing capabilities, learning repository for future decisions.

**Cost Analysis**: ~2 hours for 10-15 plans, minimal storage, zero maintenance, immediate discoverability ROI.

**Token Optimization**: ~500 tokens local search â†’ ~50 tokens GitHub search (90% reduction).

**Usage & Scope**: 2-3 monthly references, date/domain/outcome patterns, <30s retrieval target, 15/100 alignment (acceptable infrastructure).

**Priority 1: Active Plans**
- All plans in current plans/ root directory
- All active plan/* branches for multi-computer access
- Focus on immediate productivity gains

**Priority 2: High-Value Completed Plans**
- Plans with significant implementation decisions

**Priority 3: Historical Plans (Optional)**
- Comprehensive migration only if time permits
- Focus on most recent and most referenced plans
