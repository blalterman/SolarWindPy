- **Estimated Duration**: 4-6 hours
- **Status**: Planning

## Phase Overview
- [ ] **Phase 1: SystemPrompt Deployment** (Est: 1-2 hours) - Update settings.json with optimized 210-token prompt
- [ ] **Phase 2: Documentation Alignment** (Est: 2-3 hours) - Update CLAUDE.md with PR workflow and hook details

## Phase Files
1. [1-SystemPrompt-Deployment.md](./1-SystemPrompt-Deployment.md)
2. [2-Documentation-Alignment.md](./2-Documentation-Alignment.md)
3. [3-Performance-Monitoring.md](./3-Performance-Monitoring.md)

## 🎯 Objective
Optimize the Claude Code systemPrompt for SolarWindPy to provide complete context, improve productivity, and align with the sophisticated hook and agent infrastructure.

## 🧠 Context
Current systemPrompt (175 tokens) is outdated, redundant, and incomplete. It uses wrong branch patterns (`claude/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS-*` instead of `plan/*` workflow), duplicates functionality already automated by hooks, and forces unnecessary interactive branch selection every session.

**New SystemPrompt (210 tokens)**:
```
SolarWindPy: Solar wind plasma physics package. Architecture: pandas MultiIndex (M:measurement/C:component/S:species), SI units, mw²=2kT.

Agents: UnifiedPlanCoordinator (all planning/implementation), PhysicsValidator (units/constraints), DataFrameArchitect (MultiIndex), TestEngineer (coverage), PlottingEngineer, FitFunctionSpecialist, NumericalStabilityGuard.

Hooks automate: SessionStart (branch validation/context), PreToolUse (physics/git checks), PostToolUse (test execution), PreCompact (state snapshots), Stop (coverage report).

Workflow: plan/* branches for planning, feature/* for code. PRs from plan/* to master trigger CI/security/docs checks. No direct master commits. Follow CLAUDE.md. Session context loads automatically.
```
