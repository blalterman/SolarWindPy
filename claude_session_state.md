### **Latest Achievements (2025-08-12)**
âœ… **Plotting Test Plan Implementation COMPLETED** - Successfully implemented comprehensive 18-phase test suite covering 100% of plotting modules. 639 tests passing (99.8% success rate) including visual validation, integration testing, and performance benchmarks. Agent-driven development using full ecosystem coordination (PlanManager, PlanImplementer, TestEngineer, PlottingEngineer, GitIntegration). Complete closeout with featureâ†’planâ†’master merge workflow.

âœ… **Session Compaction File Cleanup COMPLETED** - Removed misleading session-compaction-2025-08-12-plotting-enhancement that incorrectly claimed implementation completion when only plan enhancement was done. Maintained accurate progress tracking.

âœ… **Plan Structure Fixes COMPLETED** - Fixed numbering issues in plotting test plan, resolving Phase 11 gap and 18 vs 19 file discrepancy. All phase files now properly numbered 1-18 with correct references in Overview.md.

âœ… **Test Directory Consolidation COMPLETED** - Successfully migrated split test directories to unified `/tests/` structure following Python packaging best practices. All 25 test files + data migrated, imports fixed, path issues resolved. Commit: 72c30d2

âœ… **Circular Import Audit COMPLETED** - Comprehensive audit found zero circular imports across 55 modules. Added CI/CD integration for ongoing monitoring, fixed all LaTeX string literal warnings in plotting labels. Package confirmed to have excellent import architecture. Commit: c4f0872

### **Current Work Status**
