- **Infrastructure**: Requirements consolidation, documentation pipeline, CI/CD optimization
- **Code Quality**: Industry-standard imports, standardized pytest configuration

## ðŸŽ¯ **CURRENT STATUS: DEVELOPMENT READY**

### **Active Development Plans (4)**
1. **compaction-agent-system** - In progress
2. **session-continuity-protocol** - Planning phase  
3. **combined_test_plan_with_checklist_plotting** - In progress
4. **combined_test_plan_with_checklist_solar_activity** - In progress

### **System Capabilities**
- **Agent Framework**: Streamlined PlanManager + PlanImplementer with velocity tracking
- **Template System**: 0-overview + N-phase architecture
- **Environment**: solarwindpy-20250404 active, Sphinx validated, requirements automated
- **Token Efficiency**: 80% agent reduction + 46% template reduction achieved

### **Latest Achievements (2025-08-12)**
âœ… **Test Directory Consolidation COMPLETED** - Successfully migrated split test directories to unified `/tests/` structure following Python packaging best practices. All 25 test files + data migrated, imports fixed, path issues resolved. Commit: 72c30d2

âœ… **Circular Import Audit COMPLETED** - Comprehensive audit found zero circular imports across 55 modules. Added CI/CD integration for ongoing monitoring, fixed all LaTeX string literal warnings in plotting labels. Package confirmed to have excellent import architecture. Commit: c4f0872

âœ… **TestEngineer Agent Compliance COMPLETED** - Updated TestEngineer agent for full compliance with `/tests/` structure. Fixed applies_to paths, test structure documentation, and example commands to align with test directory consolidation. Agent now correctly guides to root-level tests/ organization. Commit: 6a53e61

âœ… **CLAUDE.md Agent Integration COMPLETED** - Refactored CLAUDE.md from manual workflows to agent-driven development protocol. Removed conflicting git/testing guidance, eliminated redundant agent descriptions, deleted Planning Agents Ecosystem section. Now serves as gateway to agent ecosystem with proper coordination protocols. Commit: b3d7e4f

âœ… **CLAUDE.md @import Syntax COMPLETED** - Converted all markdown links to official @import syntax per Anthropic Claude Code best practices. Maintains agent-centric workflow while following technical standards for file imports and memory management. Commit: a132a9c

### **Current Work Status**
- **Latest Major Achievements**: âœ… Test Directory Consolidation + Circular Import Audit + TestEngineer Agent Compliance + CLAUDE.md Agent Integration + @import Syntax COMPLETED (2025-08-12)
- **Test Infrastructure**: Fully consolidated to unified `/tests/` structure with 696 passing tests
- **Import Architecture**: âœ… VALIDATED - Zero circular imports, CI/CD monitoring active, LaTeX warnings resolved
- **GitIntegrationAgent**: âœ… OPERATIONAL and integrated with planning agents
- **Agent System**: All planning agents updated and token-optimized

**Session State**: âœ… AGENT ECOSYSTEM OPTIMIZED - Test directory consolidation, circular import audit, TestEngineer compliance, and CLAUDE.md agent integration all completed successfully. Package architecture validated, agent workflows aligned, ready for agent-driven development priorities.
