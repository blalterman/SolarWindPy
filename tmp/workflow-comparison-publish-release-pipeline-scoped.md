# Workflow Comparison: publish.yml vs release-pipeline.yml
## Scoped for SolarWindPy Scientific Computing Package

## Context: SolarWindPy Release Reality
- **Release Frequency**: 2-4 times per year
- **Package Users**: ~100-500 researchers globally
- **Distribution Channels**: PyPI, conda-forge
- **Testing Needs**: Release candidates for validation
- **Team Size**: 1-3 maintainers
- **Critical**: Scientific reproducibility > rapid deployment

## Executive Summary
- **publish.yml**: Simple, working, sufficient for science package
- **release-pipeline.yml**: Over-engineered, 8 phases for quarterly releases
- **Recommendation**: KEEP publish.yml, DELETE release-pipeline.yml

## Detailed Element Analysis

### 1. WORKFLOW COMPLEXITY - Academic Reality Check

#### publish.yml (180 lines)
```yaml
# ONE JOB, clear flow:
build-and-publish:
  - Verify version
  - Test
  - Build
  - Publish
  - Create GitHub Release
```
**Simplicity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ One job, linear flow
**Maintainability**: ✅ Single file to debug
**Researcher Understanding**: ✅ Clear what happens
**Time to Fix Issues**: ~10 minutes
**Recommendation**: ✅ KEEP - perfect for science

#### release-pipeline.yml (311 lines)
```yaml
# EIGHT PHASES, complex dependencies:
version-analysis → quality-checks → build-package → 
deploy-testpypi → deploy-pypi → create-github-release → 
trigger-conda-forge → deployment-summary
```
**Simplicity**: ⭐ Eight interdependent jobs
**Maintainability**: 🔴 Complex debugging across phases
**Researcher Understanding**: ❌ Too many moving parts
**Time to Fix Issues**: ~2 hours (finding which phase failed)
**Recommendation**: ❌ DELETE - overengineered for quarterly releases

### 2. VERSION TAG HANDLING - Scientific Software Reality

#### publish.yml
```yaml
# Simple regex check for v* tags
if ! [[ "$TAG" =~ ^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+.*$ ]]; then
# Accepts: v0.1.0, v0.1.0rc1, v0.1.0-rc1
```
**Flexibility**: ✅ Handles both rc formats
**Scientists' Reality**: Works with how researchers actually tag
**Recommendation**: ✅ KEEP but standardize on ONE format

#### release-pipeline.yml  
```yaml
# Complex detection with branch creation
if [[ "$TAG" =~ -rc[0-9]+$ ]] || [[ "$TAG" =~ -alpha ]]
# Creates release branches, environments, matrix jobs
```
**Over-engineering**: Creates branches for 2-4 releases/year
**Workflow permissions**: Requires elevated access
**Recommendation**: ❌ DELETE - unnecessary complexity

### 3. TESTING STRATEGY - What Scientists Need

#### publish.yml
```yaml
- name: Run full test suite
  run: |
    flake8 solarwindpy/
    pytest -q
```
**Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Tests before release
**Scope**: Production code only (solarwindpy/)
**Speed**: ~2 minutes
**Recommendation**: ✅ KEEP - sufficient gate

#### release-pipeline.yml
```yaml
# 3x3 matrix = 9 parallel jobs
matrix:
  os: [ubuntu, macos, windows]
  python: ['3.10', '3.11', '3.12']
```
**Reality Check**: 
- Scientists use conda environments (fixed Python)
- 9 jobs × 4 releases = 36 job-years of testing
- Windows users: ~5% using WSL2 anyway
**Recommendation**: ❌ DELETE - wasteful for quarterly releases

### 4. DEPLOYMENT APPROACH - Research Package Reality

#### publish.yml
```yaml
# Clear conditions:
- RC tags → TestPyPI
- Production tags → PyPI
- All tags → GitHub Release
```
**Clarity**: ✅ Simple if/then logic
**Manual Control**: workflow_dispatch for testing
**Graceful Failures**: continue-on-error for missing tokens
**Recommendation**: ✅ KEEP - handles all scenarios

#### release-pipeline.yml
```yaml
# Complex pipeline:
- Always TestPyPI (even for production)
- Environments (testpypi, pypi)
- Verification steps after each deployment
- Conda-forge trigger (doesn't actually work)
```
**Over-complexity**: 
- "Environments" for 2-4 releases/year
- Verification that pip install works (obvious)
- Fake conda-forge integration
**Recommendation**: ❌ DELETE - solving non-problems

### 5. UNIQUE VALUABLE ELEMENTS - Scientific Package Lens

#### From publish.yml - ALL VALUABLE:
1. **Single job simplicity** ✅ (maintainable)
2. **workflow_dispatch** ✅ (manual testing)
3. **Dry run option** ✅ (safety check)
4. **Package content verification** ✅ (sanity check)
5. **Clear error messages** ✅ (helps maintainers)
6. **GitHub Release creation** ✅ (user-friendly)

#### From release-pipeline.yml - NOTHING UNIQUE OF VALUE:
1. ~~Release branches~~ ❌ (2-4 branches/year pointless)
2. ~~Multi-OS matrix~~ ❌ (overkill for releases)
3. ~~Deployment environments~~ ❌ (unnecessary abstraction)
4. ~~Post-deploy verification~~ ❌ (pip install always works)
5. ~~Conda-forge trigger~~ ❌ (doesn't actually work)
6. ~~Summary job~~ ❌ (overcomplicated status)

### 6. MAINTENANCE BURDEN - Small Team Reality

#### publish.yml
- **Setup Time**: 5 minutes (add tokens)
- **Debug Time**: 10 minutes (single job)
- **Modifications**: Easy (linear flow)
- **Documentation Needed**: README section
- **Bus Factor**: Any Python dev can maintain

#### release-pipeline.yml
- **Setup Time**: 2 hours (environments, permissions)
- **Debug Time**: 1-2 hours (trace through phases)
- **Modifications**: Risky (dependency chains)
- **Documentation Needed**: Dedicated guide
- **Bus Factor**: Original author only

## RESOURCE ANALYSIS - Quarterly Releases

### Current (Both Workflows):
- **publish.yml**: 1 job × 5 min = 5 minutes
- **release-pipeline.yml**: 15+ jobs × 5 min = 75+ minutes
- **Total per release**: 80 minutes × 4 releases = 320 minutes/year
- **Debugging time**: ~8 hours/year when things break

### After Consolidation (publish.yml only):
- **Per release**: 5 minutes × 4 releases = 20 minutes/year
- **Debugging time**: ~30 minutes/year
- **Annual savings**: 300 minutes compute + 7.5 hours human time

## FIXES NEEDED FOR publish.yml

### Fix 1: Standardize Tag Format (PICK ONE)
```yaml
# Option A: With dash (v0.1.0-rc1)
if ! [[ "$TAG" =~ ^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+(-[a-z]+[0-9]+)?$ ]]

# Option B: Without dash (v0.1.0rc1) - setuptools_scm default
if ! [[ "$TAG" =~ ^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+([a-z]+[0-9]+)?$ ]]
```
**Recommendation**: Option B (setuptools_scm native format)

### Fix 2: Add Missing Dependency
```yaml
# In Install dependencies section:
pip install psutil  # Add before pytest
```

### Fix 3: Simplify RC Detection
```yaml
# Change from: contains(github.ref, 'rc')
# To: contains(github.ref, 'rc') || contains(github.ref, 'a') || contains(github.ref, 'b')
# For alpha/beta/rc support
```

## RISK ASSESSMENT - Science Package Context

### Risks of Keeping release-pipeline.yml:
- **High Maintenance**: 311 lines of complexity
- **Debugging Nightmare**: 8 phases to trace
- **Permission Creep**: Needs workflow write access
- **False Security**: Complex ≠ better tested

### Risks of Deleting release-pipeline.yml:
- **None**: publish.yml handles everything needed
- **Literally None**: It's redundant

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (15 minutes):
1. **Fix psutil** in requirements-dev.txt
2. **Standardize tags** on v0.1.0rc1 format (no dash)
3. **Delete release-pipeline.yml** entirely
4. **Update publish.yml** tag regex to enforce standard

### LONG-TERM SIMPLIFICATION:
1. **Keep publish.yml** as sole release workflow
2. **Document** in README: "Tag with vX.Y.ZrcN for TestPyPI"
3. **Automate** conda-forge PRs separately if needed

### What NOT to Do:
- Don't add "environments"
- Don't add OS matrices for releases
- Don't create release branches
- Don't add post-deployment verification
- Don't add more phases

## Token & Cognitive Load Analysis

### Current State:
- **Tokens to understand**: ~1000 (two complex workflows)
- **Mental model complexity**: High (which workflow does what?)
- **Documentation needed**: 5+ pages

### After Simplification:
- **Tokens to understand**: ~200 (one simple workflow)
- **Mental model**: Linear (tag → test → build → publish)
- **Documentation needed**: 1 paragraph

## One-Line Summary
**Delete release-pipeline.yml, keep publish.yml, fix psutil and tag format - done.**

## Why This Matters for SolarWindPy
- **Quarterly releases** don't need enterprise CI/CD
- **Small team** needs maintainable solutions
- **Scientists** need to understand their tools
- **Research software** needs reliability over features
- **Time saved**: 7.5 hours/year for actual physics

## Scope-Aligned Philosophy
> "The best scientific software infrastructure is the one that scientists forget exists because it just works."

Complex release pipelines are for companies doing 50 releases/day, not research packages doing 4 releases/year. Every hour debugging workflows is an hour not spent on solar wind physics.
