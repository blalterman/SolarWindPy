## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Delete Obviously Unnecessary (Immediate)
```bash
rm .github/workflows/branch-protection.yml
rm .github/workflows/claude.yml
rm .github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml
rm .github/workflows/update-workflow-doc.yml
```

### Phase 2: Delete Over-Engineered (After Current Release)
```bash
rm .github/workflows/doctest_validation.yml
rm .github/workflows/release-management.yml
rm .github/workflows/sync-requirements.yml
```

### Phase 3: Simplify Security (Next Sprint)
- Reduce security.yml to only pip-audit
- Change trigger to weekly on master only
- Remove artifact uploads

### Final State
- 4 focused workflows
- ~430 lines of YAML (down from 1,210)
- Clear, maintainable CI/CD pipeline
- Appropriate for quarterly scientific package releases

---

## Conclusion

SolarWindPy's current CI/CD is over-engineered for its needs. A scientific Python package releasing quarterly needs:
1. **Testing** on every PR (continuous-integration.yml)
2. **Deployment** on version tags (publish.yml)
3. **Documentation** updates (docs.yml)
4. **Basic security** scanning (simplified security.yml)

Everything else is complexity without commensurate value. The proposed changes will make the project more maintainable while preserving all essential functionality.
