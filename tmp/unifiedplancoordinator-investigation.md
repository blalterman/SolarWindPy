# UnifiedPlanCoordinator Investigation Results

## Problem Statement
The UnifiedPlanCoordinator agent did not properly create GitHub issues when invoked via the Task tool. Instead of executing the GitHub CLI scripts, it only generated a text summary.

## Expected Behavior (from agent-unified-plan-coordinator.md)

### What Should Happen
According to lines 81-98 of the agent configuration:

1. **Create Overview Issue**:
   ```bash
   .claude/scripts/gh-plan-create.sh -p high -d infrastructure "Plan Name"
   ```

2. **Create Phase Issues**:
   ```bash
   .claude/scripts/gh-plan-phases.sh -q "Phase1,Phase2,Phase3" <overview-issue>
   ```

3. **Monitor Status**:
   ```bash
   .claude/scripts/gh-plan-status.sh
   ```

### Agent Capabilities
- **Line 6**: Has access to tools: `Read, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash, Grep, TodoWrite, Glob`
- **Lines 110-127**: Detailed Plan Creation Workflow using CLI scripts
- **Lines 130-143**: Shows automated content generation examples

## Actual Behavior

When invoked with:
```
Task tool -> UnifiedPlanCoordinator agent -> "Create conda feedstock automation plan"
```

The agent:
- ✅ Generated comprehensive plan content
- ✅ Created proper value propositions
- ❌ Did NOT execute any bash commands
- ❌ Did NOT call gh-plan-create.sh script
- ❌ Did NOT create any GitHub issues
- ❌ Only returned a text summary

## Root Cause Analysis

### Hypothesis 1: Agent Tool Access Issue
The agent may not be properly configured to execute Bash commands when invoked via the Task tool.

### Hypothesis 2: Agent Interpretation Issue
The agent may be interpreting the request as "generate a plan description" rather than "execute plan creation".

### Hypothesis 3: Task Tool Limitation
The Task tool may not properly pass through tool capabilities to sub-agents.

### Hypothesis 4: Agent Instructions Ambiguity
The agent instructions might not be clear enough about when to execute scripts vs. when to describe the plan.

## Evidence from Configuration

### Clear Instructions Exist (lines 110-127):
```
User: "Create plan for implementing dark mode"
Process:
1. **Create Overview Issue**: CLI script automatically generates comprehensive propositions framework content
   - Calls plan-value-generator.py hook with plan metadata
   - Injects complete 8-section propositions framework into GitHub Issue body
   - Creates issue with all value analysis, risk assessment, and scope audit sections
```

### Automated Content Generation (lines 134-136):
```bash
# Create plan with comprehensive content (fully automated)
.claude/scripts/gh-plan-create.sh -p high -d infrastructure "Dark Mode Implementation"
```

## Manual Workaround

Since the agent didn't execute the scripts, the correct manual process is:

1. **Create Overview Issue**:
   ```bash
   .claude/scripts/gh-plan-create.sh "Conda Feedstock Update Automation" \
     -p high -d infrastructure
   ```

2. **Create Phase Issues** (interactive mode):
   ```bash
   .claude/scripts/gh-plan-phases.sh [overview-issue-number]
   ```
   Then enter:
   - Phase 1: Foundation & Documentation (6-10 hours)
   - Phase 2: Automation Scripts (12-18 hours)
   - Phase 3: CI/CD Integration (11-16 hours)
   - Phase 4: Testing & Validation (10-15 hours)
   - Phase 5: Closeout (8-13 hours)

3. **Verify Labels**:
   ```bash
   gh issue list --label "plan:overview" --limit 5
   ```

## Issues Created Incorrectly

### Obsolete Issues (to be deleted):
- #314: [OBSOLETE] Conda Feedstock Update Automation - Overview
  - Missing labels: plan:overview, priority:high, status:planning, domain:infrastructure
  - Wrong content structure
  
- #315: [OBSOLETE] Phase 1: Foundation - Manual Process & Helper Scripts
  - Missing labels: plan:phase, status:planning
  - Not linked to overview
  
- #316: [OBSOLETE] Phase 2: Automation Scripts - Python Development
  - Missing labels: plan:phase, status:planning
  - Not linked to overview

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fix
1. Manually execute the GitHub CLI scripts to create proper issues
2. Delete the obsolete issues after verification
3. Ensure all new issues have correct labels and linking

### Long-term Fix
1. **Update UnifiedPlanCoordinator agent**:
   - Add explicit instructions to ALWAYS execute scripts, not describe them
   - Add validation step to confirm GitHub issues were created
   - Include error handling if scripts fail

2. **Test Agent Invocation**:
   - Verify agents can execute Bash commands when invoked via Task tool
   - Add integration tests for agent workflows

3. **Documentation Enhancement**:
   - Add troubleshooting section for when agents don't execute scripts
   - Document manual fallback procedures
   - Create agent testing guidelines

## Lessons Learned

1. **Agent Behavior Verification**: Always verify that agents execute commands rather than just describe them
2. **Manual Fallback**: Know the manual CLI commands for critical workflows
3. **Label Importance**: GitHub issue labels are critical for plan tracking and filtering
4. **Script Usage**: The `.claude/scripts/` directory contains valuable automation that should be used
5. **Agent Testing**: Need better testing of agent behavior when invoked via Task tool
