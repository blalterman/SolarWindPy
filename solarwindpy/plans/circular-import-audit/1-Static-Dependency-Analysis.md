# Phase 1: Static Dependency Analysis

**Estimated Duration**: 4-5 hours

## Overview
This phase focuses on creating comprehensive tooling for static analysis of the SolarWindPy codebase to identify import relationships and circular dependencies without executing the code.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create import analysis tooling (Est: 2 hours)
- [ ] **Develop utilities to parse Python files and extract import relationships using AST**
  - Build AST parser for Python import statements
  - Handle various import patterns (from X import Y, import X as Y, relative imports)
  - Extract module dependency relationships
  - Create utility classes for import analysis
  - Commit: `<checksum>` 
  - Status: Pending

### Task 2: Generate complete dependency graph (Est: 1.5 hours)
- [ ] **Analyze all Python files in solarwindpy/ and create NetworkX graph of imports**
  - Scan entire solarwindpy package directory structure
  - Parse all .py files for import statements
  - Build comprehensive dependency graph using NetworkX
  - Handle package-level imports and __init__.py files
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending

### Task 3: Identify circular dependencies (Est: 1 hour)
- [ ] **Use graph algorithms to detect cycles in the import dependency graph**
  - Implement cycle detection algorithms (e.g., DFS-based cycle finding)
  - Identify all circular import paths in the dependency graph
  - Rank circular imports by severity and complexity
  - Document findings with clear import chains
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending

### Task 4: Create dependency visualization (Est: 0.5 hours)
- [ ] **Generate visual diagrams of dependency relationships and circular imports**
  - Create graphical representations of dependency graph
  - Highlight circular import paths in visualizations
  - Generate both high-level module view and detailed import view
  - Export diagrams for documentation and analysis
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending

## Deliverables
- `solarwindpy/tools/import_analysis.py` - Static analysis utilities
- Dependency graph data structure (NetworkX format)
- List of identified circular imports with detailed paths
- Dependency visualization diagrams
- Analysis report with findings and recommendations

## Success Criteria
- All Python files in solarwindpy successfully parsed
- Complete dependency graph generated without errors
- All circular dependencies identified and documented
- Clear visualizations created for manual review
- Analysis tools ready for use in subsequent phases
