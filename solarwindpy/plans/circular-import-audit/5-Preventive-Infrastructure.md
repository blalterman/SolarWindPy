# Phase 5: Preventive Infrastructure

**Estimated Duration**: 1-2 hours

## Overview
This phase establishes long-term preventive measures to maintain clean import architecture and prevent the reintroduction of circular imports in future development.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Implement CI/CD circular import checks (Est: 1 hour)
- [ ] **Add automated tests to prevent future circular imports**
  - Integrate circular import detection into the existing test suite
  - Create automated checks that run on every commit/PR
  - Set up test framework to validate import integrity continuously
  - Configure CI pipeline to fail builds on circular import detection
  - Add performance regression tests for import times
  - Create reporting mechanisms for import architecture health
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending

### Task 2: Create developer guidelines (Est: 0.5 hours)
- [ ] **Document best practices for import management in SolarWindPy**
  - Write comprehensive import architecture guidelines
  - Document approved patterns for module dependencies
  - Create examples of good and bad import practices
  - Establish code review checklist for import-related changes
  - Document the preferred import structure for new modules
  - Include troubleshooting guide for common import issues
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending

### Task 3: Add pre-commit hooks (Est: 0.5 hours)
- [ ] **Integrate circular import detection into development workflow**
  - Set up pre-commit hooks for automatic import validation
  - Configure hooks to run circular import analysis before commits
  - Add import optimization checks (unused imports, formatting)
  - Integrate with existing pre-commit configuration if available
  - Provide clear error messages and resolution guidance
  - Test pre-commit hook functionality across development environments
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending

## Deliverables
- Automated CI/CD tests for import integrity
- Developer guidelines and best practices documentation
- Pre-commit hooks for import validation
- Import architecture monitoring dashboard (optional)
- Troubleshooting and resolution documentation

## Infrastructure Components

### Automated Testing
- `test_import_cycles.py` - Automated circular import detection
- `test_import_performance.py` - Performance regression tests
- CI configuration updates for import validation

### Developer Tools
- Pre-commit configuration for import checks
- VS Code/IDE configuration recommendations
- Import analysis scripts for local development

### Documentation
- `docs/import_architecture.md` - Comprehensive guidelines
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` updates with import best practices
- Code review checklist including import considerations

## Success Criteria
- Automated tests prevent circular import regressions
- Clear developer guidelines established and documented
- Pre-commit hooks successfully catch import issues
- CI/CD pipeline reliably validates import integrity
- Development workflow minimally disrupted by new tools
- All preventive measures tested and validated

## Long-term Maintenance
- Regular review of import architecture guidelines
- Periodic analysis of import performance trends
- Updates to tooling as SolarWindPy evolves
- Training for new developers on import best practices

## Integration Points
- Existing pytest test infrastructure
- Current CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, etc.)
- Code review processes and requirements
- Development environment setup and onboarding
