# Phase 4: Issue Remediation

**Estimated Duration**: 2-4 hours

## Overview
This phase focuses on actively resolving identified circular imports and optimizing the overall import structure based on findings from previous phases.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Refactor identified circular imports (Est: 1-3 hours)
- [ ] **Apply appropriate patterns (deferred imports, interface classes, dependency injection) to break cycles**
  - Analyze each circular import to determine best resolution strategy
  - Implement deferred imports (lazy loading) where appropriate
  - Create interface classes or abstract base classes to break tight coupling
  - Use dependency injection patterns for complex interdependencies
  - Apply refactoring techniques:
    - Move shared functionality to separate modules
    - Extract common interfaces or protocols
    - Use TYPE_CHECKING blocks for type-only imports
    - Implement lazy property patterns for expensive imports
  - Validate that refactoring preserves all existing functionality
  - Run comprehensive tests after each refactoring step
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending

### Task 2: Optimize import structure (Est: 1 hour)
- [ ] **Reorganize imports for better performance and maintainability**
  - Consolidate redundant imports across modules
  - Optimize import ordering within files for performance
  - Remove unused imports identified during analysis
  - Standardize import patterns across the codebase
  - Group imports logically (standard library, third-party, local)
  - Apply performance optimizations based on Phase 3 findings
  - Update __init__.py files for cleaner public API exposure
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending

## Refactoring Strategies

### Common Circular Import Patterns and Solutions
1. **Mutual Dependencies**: Extract shared functionality to a common module
2. **Type Annotations**: Use `TYPE_CHECKING` blocks and string annotations
3. **Late Binding**: Implement lazy import patterns with property decorators
4. **Interface Segregation**: Create abstract base classes to break coupling
5. **Dependency Inversion**: Use dependency injection for complex relationships

### Code Quality Guidelines
- Maintain backward compatibility for all public APIs
- Preserve existing functionality and behavior
- Add type hints where beneficial for clarity
- Update documentation strings if import behavior changes
- Ensure consistent code style with existing patterns

## Deliverables
- Refactored modules with circular imports resolved
- Optimized import structure throughout the codebase
- Updated documentation for any API changes
- Comprehensive test validation of all changes
- Performance improvements from import optimization

## Success Criteria
- All circular imports successfully resolved
- No regression in existing functionality
- Improved import performance metrics
- Cleaner, more maintainable import structure
- All tests continue to pass
- Code quality standards maintained

## Risk Mitigation
- Create backup branches before major refactoring
- Implement changes incrementally with frequent testing
- Use feature flags for risky changes if necessary
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage throughout process
- Review changes with domain experts for scientific correctness
