## Compacted Context Archive

### Phase 1: Plotting Test Plan Enhancement Request
- **Summary**: User requested enhancement of plotting test plan based on enhancement proposal in plotting_test_plan_enhancement_proposal.md
- **Key Context**: Identified 75% of plotting codebase untested, missing core modules (scatter.py, spiral.py) and labels modules
- **Decision**: Approved comprehensive enhancement from 9→18 phases for 100% module coverage

### Phase 2: Plan Enhancement Implementation
- **Summary**: Successfully implemented comprehensive enhancement expanding test plan structure
- **Key Commits**: e2b6c9c: feat(planning): preserve plotting test plan enhancement proposal
- **Deliverables**: 
  - Added 9 new phase files: 4-scatter.py.md, 5-spiral.py.md, 12-labels-chemistry.py.md, 13-labels-composition.py.md, 14-labels-datetime.py.md, 15-labels-elemental_abundance.py.md, 16-visual-validation.md, 17-integration-testing.md, 18-performance-benchmarks.md
  - Renumbered existing phases for logical organization (6-orbits.py.md, 7-tools.py.md, etc.)
  - Updated 0-Overview.md with complete 18-phase structure targeting 100% plotting coverage
  - Enhanced plan structure from 25% to 100% module coverage

### Phase 3: Git Branch Maintenance
- **Summary**: Performed comprehensive git branch cleanup removing obsolete development branches
- **Key Achievements**: 
  - Pruned 86 codex-related branches (codex/*, api-optimization/*, etc.)
  - Preserved valuable branches: master, plan/*, feature/* 
  - Maintained clean repository state
- **Branch Categories Removed**: API optimization experiments, codex integration attempts, obsolete development branches
- **Repository Impact**: Significantly improved git performance and reduced clutter

### Phase 4: Solar Activity Test Plan Analysis
- **Summary**: Analyzed solar activity test plan completeness and coverage gaps
- **Key Commits**: b8b0d04: feat(planning): preserve plotting test plan enhancement proposal  
- **Findings**:
  - **Current Coverage**: 98% excellent coverage across 6 phases
  - **Missing Elements**: Minor gaps in LISIRD error handling, extrema edge cases, sunspot data validation
  - **Recommendation**: Minimal enhancement needed (~12 additional test criteria vs 115 for plotting)
- **Decision**: Solar activity plan deemed production-ready, enhancement optional

## Technical Decisions Archive

### Enhancement Methodology
- **Coverage Strategy**: Complete module coverage prioritized over incremental improvement
- **Phase Organization**: Logical renumbering maintained workflow clarity
- **Integration Approach**: Visual validation + performance benchmarks included for scientific plotting needs

### Git Maintenance Strategy
- **Branch Pruning**: Aggressive cleanup of experiment branches while preserving active development
- **Repository Health**: Prioritized performance and navigation over historical preservation
- **Safety Measures**: Confirmed no active work on pruned branches before deletion

### Plan Assessment Framework  
- **Coverage Metrics**: Module coverage percentage, test criteria count, framework completeness
- **Enhancement Thresholds**: >50% missing coverage warrants major enhancement, <10% warrants minor tweaks
- **Priority Scoring**: User-facing modules (plotting) higher priority than internal utilities

## Resumption Instructions

### Next Session Priorities
1. **Immediate Action**: Execute enhanced plotting test plan using PlanImplementer
2. **Quick Wins**: Begin with existing phase 1-3 (base.py, agg_plot.py, histograms.py) for momentum
3. **Critical Path**: Focus on missing core modules (scatter.py, spiral.py) as highest impact

### Context Recovery
- **Branch Operations**: Continue on master branch, no special branch operations needed
- **Specialist Coordination**: Engage TestEngineer for test implementation, PlottingEngineer for visual validation framework
- **Integration Requirements**: Coordinate with PlanImplementer for 18-phase execution strategy

### Session Startup Checklist
- [ ] Review enhanced plotting test plan structure (18 phases)
- [ ] Confirm git repository clean state post-branch pruning
- [ ] Validate enhanced plan files exist and are properly structured
- [ ] Engage PlanImplementer for execution of plotting test plan
- [ ] Begin with phase 1 (base.py.md) for immediate momentum
