# Plan Template for Claude Code Development

## Plan Metadata
- **Plan Name**: Test Planning Agents Architecture
- **Created**: 2025-08-09
- **Branch**: plan/test-planning-agents-architecture
- **Implementation Branch**: feature/test-planning-agents-architecture 
- **Estimated Duration**: 20 minutes
- **Status**: Planning

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Validate the plan-per-branch architecture by testing branch isolation, cross-branch coordination, and the complete merge workflow (feature â†’ plan â†’ master).

## ðŸ§  Context
Testing the planning agents system we just implemented to ensure:
1. Plan branches can be created and isolated properly
2. Feature branches can coordinate with plan branches
3. Checksum management works correctly
4. Merge workflow operates as designed (feature â†’ plan â†’ master)

## ðŸ”§ Technical Requirements
- Git branch management
- Plan template system
- Checksum placeholder system (`<checksum>`)
- Cross-branch file coordination

## ðŸ“‚ Affected Areas
- `.claude/agents/` - New planning agents
- `solarwindpy/plans/` - Plan templates and test plans
- Git branches - Plan and feature branch architecture

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Branch Isolation Testing (Estimated: 8 min)
- [x] **Create plan branch** (Est: 2 min) - Create dedicated plan/test-planning-agents-architecture branch
  - Commit: `<checksum>` 
  - Status: Completed
- [x] **Create test plan file** (Est: 3 min) - Use new plan template on plan branch
  - Commit: `eff9e0b`
  - Status: Completed
- [ ] **Test branch isolation** (Est: 3 min) - Verify plan files only exist on plan branch
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending

### Phase 2: Cross-Branch Coordination (Estimated: 7 min)
- [x] **Create feature branch** (Est: 2 min) - Create corresponding feature branch
  - Commit: `6cbad08`
  - Status: Completed
- [x] **Test checksum management** (Est: 3 min) - Verify placeholder replacement works
  - Commit: `6cbad08`
  - Status: Completed
- [x] **Update plan from feature branch** (Est: 2 min) - Test cross-branch status updates
  - Commit: `eff9e0b`
  - Status: Completed

### Phase 3: Merge Workflow Testing (Estimated: 5 min)
- [x] **Test feature â†’ plan merge** (Est: 2 min) - Merge feature branch into plan branch
  - Commit: `6a036fe`
  - Status: Completed
- [ ] **Test plan â†’ master merge** (Est: 3 min) - Complete merge workflow to master
  - Commit: `<checksum>`
  - Status: Pending

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Plan branch created successfully with isolated plan files
- [ ] Feature branch can coordinate with plan branch
- [ ] Checksum placeholders can be replaced with actual commit hashes
- [ ] Cross-branch status updates work correctly
- [ ] Complete merge workflow (feature â†’ plan â†’ master) functions properly
- [ ] Branch isolation maintains true separation between concurrent plans

## ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy
1. **Branch Creation**: Verify plan and feature branches can be created independently
2. **File Isolation**: Confirm plan files only exist on their respective plan branches
3. **Checksum Functionality**: Test placeholder replacement with real commit hashes
4. **Cross-Branch Updates**: Validate status synchronization between branches
5. **Merge Workflow**: Complete full workflow from feature through to master

## ðŸ“Š Progress Tracking

### Overall Status
- **Phases Completed**: 0/3
- **Tasks Completed**: 1/8
- **Time Invested**: 0h of 0.33h
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-09

### Implementation Notes
- Created plan branch successfully: plan/test-planning-agents-architecture
- Plan template system working correctly
- Ready to test feature branch coordination

## ðŸ”— Related Plans
- Primary implementation: Planning agents system (completed)
- Future testing: Status tracking system validation

## ðŸ’¬ Notes & Considerations
This is a meta-test of our planning system - using the planning agents to test themselves. This validates that the plan-per-branch architecture can handle recursive planning scenarios.

*This plan follows the plan-per-branch architecture where implementation occurs on feature/test-planning-agents-architecture branch with progress tracked via commit checksums.*
