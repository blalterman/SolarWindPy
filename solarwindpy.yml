# SolarWindPy Conda Environment File
#
# This file lists packages WITHOUT version pins. This is intentional:
# 1. Conda resolves to latest compatible versions from conda-forge
# 2. `pip install -e .` enforces pyproject.toml's minimum requirements
# 3. Avoids PyPI/conda-forge version mismatches that break CI
#
# Technical details: .claude/docs/root-cause-analysis/pr-405-conda-patching.md
#
# NOTE: Python version is dynamically injected by GitHub Actions workflows
# during matrix testing to support multiple Python versions.
#
# NOTE: Pip-only packages (e.g., ast-grep-py) are included in the pip: subsection
# at the end of dependencies and installed automatically during env creation.
#
# For local use:
#   conda env create -f solarwindpy.yml
#   conda activate solarwindpy
#   pip install -e .  # Installs SolarWindPy in editable mode
