"""Consolidated test configuration for SolarWindPy.

This file provides shared test configuration for all tests in the consolidated /tests/
directory structure. It enables external package imports for migrated tests from
solarwindpy/tests/.
"""

# Tests in the /tests/ directory should use external package imports
# (e.g., "import solarwindpy" instead of relative imports)
# No special module path configuration needed for external imports
