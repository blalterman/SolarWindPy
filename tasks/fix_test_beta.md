# Fix test_beta

Assigned to: blalterman

The `test_beta` test is skipped due to DataFrame shape mismatches when computing plasma beta. Unskip the test and debug the `Plasma.beta` method to ensure it returns the expected structure for all species combinations.

Steps:
1. Remove the skip marker from `test_beta` in `tests/test_plasma.py`.
2. Run the failing test to capture the mismatch.
3. Inspect the calculation of magnetic and thermal pressures used for beta.
4. Correct the implementation or adjust expectations in the test suite.
5. Verify all tests pass after the fix.
