## Agent Interaction Patterns

### Priority Cascade
1. **Always Active:** General → PhysicsValidator → DataFrameArchitect
2. **Feature Development:** TestEngineer → Domain Specialist → DocumentationMaintainer
3. **Code Quality:** CodeRefactorer → PerformanceOptimizer → NumericalStabilityGuard
4. **Release Prep:** DependencyManager → CIAgent → DocumentationMaintainer

### Collaboration Rules
- PhysicsValidator must approve all core physics changes
- TestEngineer validates all new code before merge
- DataFrameArchitect reviews all data structure modifications
- Multiple agents can work in parallel on independent modules
- Conflicts resolved by priority level (High > Medium > Low)

### Validation Checkpoints
- Pre-commit: Format (black) → Lint (flake8) → Test (pytest)
- Pre-merge: Coverage check → Documentation build → CI pass
- Post-merge: Performance regression → Numerical accuracy → API compatibility

## Domain-Specific Guidelines

### Solar Wind Physics
- Alfvén speed calculations must account for ion composition
- Coulomb collisions require valid temperature/density ranges
- Instability thresholds depend on plasma beta and anisotropy
- Preserve SI units internally, convert for display only

### Data Processing
- Missing data indicated by NaN, not zero or -999
- Interpolation methods must preserve physical constraints
- Time series must maintain chronological order
- Quality flags carried through analysis pipeline

### Visualization Standards
- Default to publication-quality figures
- Support both interactive and static plotting
- Color schemes must be colorblind-friendly
- Axes labels include units when applicable

## Emergency Protocols

### Test Failure
1. Identify failing test(s) with `pytest -v`
2. Check recent changes with `git diff`
3. Verify environment with `conda list`
4. Run isolated test with `pytest path/to/test::specific_test`
5. If physics-related, consult PhysicsValidator agent

### Performance Degradation
1. Profile with `python -m cProfile`
2. Check DataFrame memory usage with `.memory_usage(deep=True)`
3. Review recent numba compilation
4. Consider algorithmic improvements before optimization

### Data Corruption
1. Validate against known test data in `tests/data/`
2. Check MultiIndex integrity
3. Verify datetime index continuity
4. Restore from version control if necessary
