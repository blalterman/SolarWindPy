⚠️ **Important:** This analysis uses AI estimation, not calculated metrics.
Treat recommendations as preliminary exploration, not formal decisions.
For production plans, use `gh-plan-create.sh` with automated proposition generation.

**🤖 Proposition 9 (AI Execution Assessment)** provides actionable guidance on execution strategy, prompt improvements, agent selection, and clarifications needed to optimize AI execution success.

### 9. AI Execution Assessment
Evaluate how effectively an AI agent can execute the task autonomously, identifying clarifications needed, decision points, and prompt optimizations for successful execution.

**Assessment Dimensions (0-100 scale each):**

**Requirement Clarity (Weight: 25%)**
- Ambiguity detection: Are terms concrete and measurable?
- Sufficiency: Are what/why/success-criteria/constraints specified?
- Executability: Can AI execute without clarification?
- **Scoring Bands:**
  - 90-100: Zero ambiguity, complete specification, immediate executability
  - 70-89: Minor ambiguity (1-2 clarifications), mostly complete
  - 50-69: Moderate ambiguity (2-3 clarifications), partial specification
  - 0-49: High ambiguity (3+ clarifications), incomplete specification

**Context Complexity (Weight: 15%)**
- Domain knowledge depth: Surface/moderate/deep expertise required?
- Module coupling: Single module or complex dependencies?
- Token budget impact: <5K, 5K-25K, or >25K tokens?
- **Scoring Bands:**
  - 90-100: Deep domain + high coupling + large token budget
  - 70-89: Deep domain OR high coupling OR large token budget
  - 50-69: Moderate across dimensions
  - 0-49: Surface-level + low coupling + small token budget

**Decision Points (Weight: 20%, INVERTED - lower score = more decisions)**
- Decision count: How many human decisions required?
- Decision complexity: Simple pattern selection or novel architectural?
- Reversibility: Code-only changes or irreversible schema changes?
- **Scoring Bands:**
  - 90-100: Zero decisions or all have clear precedent
  - 70-89: 1-2 simple decisions with documented tradeoffs
  - 50-69: 2-3 decisions OR 1 complex architectural decision
  - 0-49: 3+ decisions OR complex novel decisions OR irreversible

**Error Recovery Capability (Weight: 20%)**
- Error diagnosability: Clear actionable messages or cryptic failures?
- Self-correction feasibility: Can AI autonomously fix most errors?
- Feedback loop speed: Instant (<10s), moderate (1-5min), or slow (>5min)?
- **Scoring Bands:**
  - 90-100: Clear errors + self-correcting + fast feedback
  - 70-89: Clear errors + mostly self-correcting + moderate feedback
  - 50-69: Somewhat clear + partially self-correcting
  - 0-49: Cryptic errors + manual debugging + slow feedback

**Agent Coordination (Weight: 10%, INVERTED - lower score = more agents)**
- Agent count: Single agent, 2 agents, or 3+ agents?
- Handoff clarity: Explicit interfaces or ambiguous coordination?
- Parallel vs sequential: Independent work or tightly coupled?
- **Scoring Bands:**
  - 90-100: Single agent or no specialized agent
  - 70-89: 2 agents with clear handoff
  - 50-69: 2-3 agents with reasonable handoff clarity
  - 0-49: 3+ agents OR ambiguous handoffs OR tightly coupled

**Prompt Optimization (Weight: 10%)**
- Current prompt quality: Optimal, good, or poor?
- Improvement opportunities: None, minor, or major needed?
- Success-maximizing patterns: Follows all, most, or few best practices?
- **Scoring Bands:**
  - 90-100: Optimal (specific, examples, criteria, constraints, steps)
  - 70-89: Good (specific, criteria, constraints; missing 1-2 elements)
  - 50-69: Fair (specific but missing 2-3 elements)
  - 0-49: Poor (vague, missing multiple elements)

**Composite Score Formula:**
```
AI_Execution_Score = (
  Requirement_Clarity × 0.25 +
  Error_Recovery × 0.20 +
  Decision_Points × 0.20 +
  Context_Complexity × 0.15 +
  Agent_Coordination × 0.10 +
  Prompt_Optimization × 0.10
)
```

- **70-89: GUIDED** - AI executes with 1-2 clarifications, minimal human input
- **50-69: COLLABORATIVE** - Significant human-AI collaboration, multiple decision points
- **0-49: HUMAN-LED** - Human leads, AI provides support only

**Flag Generation:**

**5 Prompt Improvement Patterns:**
1. **Add Concrete Examples** (for Clarity < 70): "e.g., convert Plasma.thermal_speed from CGS (cm/s) to SI (m/s)"
2. **Specify Success Criteria** (for Decisions < 70): "≥95% test coverage, zero breaking changes to public API"
3. **Enumerate Edge Cases** (for Recovery < 70): "NaN → preserve as NaN, empty → ValueError, partial → document limitation"
4. **Step-by-Step Breakdown** (for Complexity > 70): "1. Create Species class, 2. Refactor Ion, 3. Validate physics, 4. Update tests"
5. **Reference Existing Patterns** (universal): "Follow solarwindpy/plotting/hist1d.py pattern: accept Plasma object, use matplotlib defaults, return fig/ax"

**Output Format:**
For each dimension, provide:
- Score (0-100)
- Key findings (1-2 sentences)
