### 2. Cover Letter Structure

#### Opening Hook
```
I'm applying to Anthropic to help build AI systems that researchers and scientists can
trust. My work developing SolarWindPy demonstrates a model for AI-assisted scientific
software development that prioritizes safety, verification, and domain expertise—
principles that align directly with Anthropic's mission.
```

#### Narrative Arc

**Paragraph 1 - The Challenge**:
> Scientific software requires both domain expertise and engineering rigor. Researchers
often lack time to build production-grade tools, leading to reliability issues. I faced
this challenge transforming my thesis code into a community package.

**Paragraph 2 - The AI Solution (Innovation)**:
> Rather than simply using AI to write code, I built specialized infrastructure:
domain-specific validation agents that check physics correctness, automated workflows
that ensure quality, and systematic review processes that maintain scientific accuracy.
This enabled rapid development while exceeding typical scientific software quality standards.

**Paragraph 3 - Results & Impact**:
> The result is SolarWindPy: a production package on PyPI and conda-forge with comprehensive
testing (≥95% coverage target), automated validation, and documented AI-assisted workflows.
The infrastructure itself is published in the repository's `.claude/` directory, enabling
other researchers to adopt similar approaches.

**Paragraph 4 - Why Anthropic**:
> This experience taught me that AI's value isn't just in generating code—it's in building
systems that make AI outputs safe, reliable, and trustworthy. That's Anthropic's core
mission, and where I want to contribute.

## Interview Preparation

### Key Stories (STAR Format)

#### Story 1: "The Physics Validation Problem"

**Situation**: AI suggested code with incorrect thermal speed formula √(kT/m) instead of √(2kT/m)

**Task**: Needed systematic way to catch physics errors that aren't syntax errors

**Action**: Built PhysicsValidator agent with domain-specific rules encoded for common physics mistakes

**Result**: Automated detection of physics errors before they reach production, catching 3-4 similar issues in subsequent development

**Key Learning**: Generic AI needs domain-specific validation; automation augments but doesn't replace expertise

---

#### Story 2: "Coverage vs. Quality Trade-off"

**Situation**: Project at 78% coverage, targeting 95%, limited time

**Task**: Prioritize what to test first without appearing to accept low quality

**Action**:
- Comprehensive tests for core physics and plasma functionality (100% coverage)
- Iterative development for utilities (fitfunctions, plotting)
- Transparent documentation in JOSS paper about what's tested vs in development

**Result**:
- Critical functionality fully tested and reliable
- Users can trust core calculations
- Honest about development state builds credibility

**Key Learning**: Scientific priorities matter; 100% of critical features > 80% across board

---

#### Story 3: "Infrastructure Investment Decision"

**Situation**: Could use Claude directly for quick code generation, or invest time building infrastructure

**Task**: Balance immediate development velocity vs long-term efficiency and quality

**Action**:
- Invested upfront in specialized agents and automated workflows
- Built pre-commit hooks for continuous validation
- Created reproducible infrastructure in `.claude/` directory

**Result**:
- Faster development with quality assurance baked in
- Prevented errors from reaching users
- Infrastructure reusable for future projects

**Key Learning**: Upfront investment in AI safety infrastructure pays off—lesson applicable to Anthropic's mission

---

### Expected Questions & Answers

#### Q: "Why build custom agents instead of using Claude directly?"

**A**: "Direct AI usage is great for prototyping, but production scientific software needs domain-specific validation. Generic AI doesn't know that thermal speed should use √(2kT/m), not √(kT/m). By building specialized agents, I encoded domain knowledge into the development workflow, catching errors before they reach production. This systematic approach is more reliable than hoping I'll catch every issue in manual review. It's the difference between using AI and building with AI."

---

#### Q: "How do you ensure AI-generated code is scientifically correct?"

**A**: "Three layers of verification:

First, automated physics validation hooks check formulas, units, and constraints before code is committed. These catch common mistakes like wrong factors or unit inconsistencies.

Second, comprehensive test suites verify behavior against known results from published research and standard test cases.

Third—and most critical—I review all AI-generated code for scientific accuracy. The AI accelerates development and handles boilerplate, but expert review remains essential for correctness in scientific computing.

This layered approach mirrors what I understand about Anthropic's approach to AI safety: multiple verification mechanisms rather than relying on a single check."

---

#### Q: "Your coverage is 78%, not your 95% target. How do you justify that?"

**A**: "It's about scientific priorities. Core physics and plasma functionality—the critical calculations researchers depend on—are comprehensively tested at effectively 100% coverage. Tests for utilities like plotting and fitting capabilities are in development.

I'd rather have 100% coverage of critical functions and 50% of utilities than 80% across the board. When scientists use SolarWindPy to analyze spacecraft data, they need to trust the plasma calculations are correct. Whether the plots have perfect labels is secondary.

The JOSS paper is transparent about this because I believe honesty about development state matters more than claiming perfect metrics. Anthropic's approach to transparency around AI capabilities resonates with me for the same reason."

---

#### Q: "What would you do differently if starting over?"

**A**: "I'd build the infrastructure earlier. I initially used AI directly for code generation, then retrofitted validation infrastructure after catching a few errors. Starting with the agent architecture from day one would have prevented issues that required later fixes.

This taught me that upfront investment in AI safety infrastructure pays off—you catch problems before they compound. It's the same principle behind Anthropic's work on Constitutional AI: bake safety in from the start rather than patch it on later.

For Anthropic, I'd apply this lesson: invest early in safety infrastructure, even when rapid development is tempting."

---

#### Q: "Tell me about a time AI made a significant error you caught."

**A**: "The thermal speed formula incident is a good example. AI suggested using √(kT/m) for thermal speed calculations—syntactically correct, runs without errors, but physically wrong by a factor of √2. This matters because thermal speed affects interpretations of plasma temperature and energy.

I caught it in review because I know the physics, but realized this type of error could slip through if I wasn't vigilant. That led to building the PhysicsValidator agent specifically to catch these domain-specific mistakes.

The broader lesson: AI can be confident and wrong. Syntax correctness doesn't mean domain correctness. This is why Anthropic's focus on making AI helpful, harmless, and honest matters—confidence without correctness is dangerous in critical applications."

---

#### Q: "How would you help researchers adopt AI safely?"

**A**: "Based on my experience with SolarWindPy, I'd focus on three things:

**Infrastructure over education**: Don't just tell researchers 'review AI code carefully'—give them tools that automate common checks. Most researchers aren't software engineers; they need guardrails built in.

**Domain-specific validation**: Generic AI safety isn't enough. Researchers need AI that understands their domain's correctness criteria. That might mean building validation agents for different scientific fields.

**Transparency and reproducibility**: Make the infrastructure visible and documented. The `.claude/` directory in SolarWindPy lets others see exactly how AI was used and what checks are in place. This builds trust and enables adoption.

At Anthropic, this could mean developing field-specific safety frameworks for scientific computing, medical applications, or legal research—domains where correctness is critical and expertise is required."
