## Executive Summary

This documentation covers **8 features** (7 original + plugin packaging) for integrating Claude Code capabilities into SolarWindPy's workflow:

| Feature | Type | Impact | Effort | Decision Gate | ROI Break-even | Plugin-Ready |
|---------|------|--------|--------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| [Memory Hierarchy](./01_memory_hierarchy.md) | Auto | CRITICAL | 19-30h | ≥30% token reduction | 4-6 weeks | ❌ Infrastructure |
| [Slash Commands](./07_slash_commands.md) | Manual | HIGH | 8.5-12h | ≥60 min/week saved | 3-4 weeks | ✅ Yes |
| [Skills System](./02_skills_system.md) | Auto | HIGH | 7-11h | ≥40% automation rate | 3-4 weeks | ✅ Yes |
| [Subagents](./03_subagents.md) | Auto | MED-HIGH | 14.5-21h | ≥40% token savings | 6-9 weeks | ✅ Yes |
| [Enhanced Hooks](./04_enhanced_hooks.md) | Auto | LOW-MED | 5.5-8.5h | 100% activity tracking | 4-6 weeks | ⚠️ Partial |
| [Checkpointing](./05_checkpointing.md) | Auto | LOW-MED | 3.5-4.5h | Zero rollback friction | 3-5 weeks | ❌ Core Feature |
| [Output Styles](./06_output_styles.md) | Manual | LOW | 2.5-3.5h | User satisfaction | 8-12 weeks | ❌ Local Config |
| **[Plugin Packaging](./08_plugin_packaging.md)** | **Infra** | **HIGH** | **8-12h** | **Install success** | **Immediate** | **N/A** |

**Combined Impact:**
- **Implementation:** 69-106 hours over 8-9 weeks
  - Individual features: 68.5-102.5h (Memory 19-30h + Commands 8.5-12h + Skills 7-11h + Subagents 14.5-21h + Hooks 5.5-8.5h + Checkpointing 3.5-4.5h + Styles 2.5-3.5h + Plugin 8-12h)
  - Integration & testing overhead: 0.5-3.5h (cross-feature testing, decision gate validation, documentation review)
  - **Total: 69-106h** (rounded, includes comprehensive stopping conditions & error recovery)
- **Token Savings:** 50-70% overall reduction
  - **Methodology:** Memory (30-50% savings across all sessions) + Subagents (40-60% savings for complex tasks, ~20-30% of work)
  - **Calculation:** Base savings from Memory: 30-50% (applies universally) + Additional savings from Subagents: 20-30% of sessions × 40-60% savings = 8-18% additional
  - **Combined:** 38-68% realistic baseline, 50-70% achievable with heavy subagent usage for complex analyses
  - **Non-overlapping contexts:** Memory reduces repeated context-setting across all sessions; Subagents isolate complex analysis tasks to prevent context pollution
- **Time Savings:** 350-670 hours annually
- **Break-even:** 3-6 weeks (faster via single-command plugin install)
- **Bonus:** Community distribution capability via marketplace
- **Safety:** Comprehensive stopping conditions prevent over-investment

## Feature Relationship Map

### Complementary Feature Pairs

```
Defense in Depth Pattern:
Manual Control (Slash Commands)
    ↓ complements
Automatic Detection (Skills)
    ↓ complements
Event-Based Prevention (Hooks)

Example: Physics Validation
├── /physics → Manual on-demand check
├── physics-validator skill → Auto-activates during calculations
└── PreToolUse hook → Blocks invalid physics before edits
```

### Integration Patterns

| Pattern | Features Used | Workflow Example |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| **Context Management** | Memory + Skills + Slash Commands | Memory stores physics rules → Skills auto-reference → `/physics` manual check |
| **Workflow Automation** | Slash Commands + Skills + Hooks | `/test` triggers testing → Skills detect gaps → Hooks enforce coverage |
| **Complex Analysis** | Subagents + Memory + Skills | Memory provides context → Skills detect need → Subagent performs isolated analysis |
| **Quality Assurance** | Hooks + Skills + Slash Commands | Hooks prevent errors → Skills auto-validate → `/review` final check |

## Plugin vs. Local Implementation

### Decision Matrix: Which Features Are Plugin-Packageable?

**Install via Plugin (Distributable):**
- ✅ **Slash Commands** - Team-shared workflows, standardized shortcuts
- ✅ **Skills** - Auto-activating validators and generators
- ✅ **Agents/Subagents** - Specialized analysis tools
- ⚠️ **Hooks (Partial)** - Configurations yes, executable scripts may need local install

**Keep Local (Project-Specific):**
- ❌ **Memory Hierarchy** - Unique to SolarWindPy codebase (physics rules, MultiIndex structure)
- ❌ **Output Styles** - Personal/team preferences for response patterns
- ❌ **Checkpointing** - Core Claude Code feature (not configurable)

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1:** Implement features locally in `.claude/` (validate functionality)
**Phase 2:** Package validated features as plugin (enable distribution)
**Phase 3:** Test plugin installation locally (ensure portability)
**Phase 4:** Distribute via marketplace (team or public)

**Key Insight:** Both approaches are valid. Plugins add distribution capability, but local implementation works identically.

---

## Prioritized Implementation Roadmap

**Anthropic Best Practice:** Start simple, add complexity only when demonstrably beneficial. This roadmap implements progressive phases with decision gates to prevent over-investment.

### Phase 0: Foundation (REQUIRED)
**Priority: CRITICAL - Must complete before any other phases**

**Goal:** Establish core context management and manual workflow shortcuts that all other features depend on.

1. **[Memory Hierarchy](./01_memory_hierarchy.md)** (Weeks 1-2, 19-28 hours)
   - *Why first:* Foundation for all other features; enables context preservation
   - *Impact:* 30-50% token savings, zero repeated context-setting
   - *Enables:* Skills and Slash Commands can reference memory files
   - *Stopping Conditions:* Max 20 memory imports/session, ≤10% context budget allocation
   - *Note:* NOT plugin-packageable (project-specific infrastructure)

2. **[Slash Commands](./07_slash_commands.md)** (Week 2, parallel, 8.5-12 hours) ✅ Plugin-Ready
   - *Why parallel:* Independent of Memory, high impact, low effort
   - *Impact:* 60+ min/week saved on frequent manual workflows
   - *Start with:* `/coverage`, `/physics`, `/test` (3 commands, 30 min setup)
   - *Error Recovery:* Timeout handling, fallback chains for all 10 commands
   - *Plugin:* Package in `plugin-name/commands/`

**Decision Gate 1: Proceed to Phase 1?**
- ✅ **PROCEED if:** ≥30% token reduction sustained AND ≥60 min/week saved
- ⚠️ **PAUSE if:** <30% token reduction (refine memory files, add missing context)
- ❌ **STOP if:** No measurable improvement (investigate root cause before continuing)

---

### Phase 1: Automation (CONDITIONAL)
**Priority: HIGH - Only if Phase 0 proves effective**

**Goal:** Layer automatic detection and delegation on top of manual foundation.

3. **[Skills System](./02_skills_system.md)** (Weeks 3-4, 7-11 hours) ✅ Plugin-Ready
   - *Why after Memory:* Skills reference memory for activation context
   - *Impact:* 40-60% reduction in manual agent coordination
   - *Complements:* Slash commands (automatic vs manual control)
   - *Stopping Conditions:* Rate limiting (5-12 activations/hour per skill)
   - *Error Recovery:* Fallback chains (Primary → Manual → Subagent → Override)
   - *Plugin:* Package in `plugin-name/skills/`

4. **[Subagents](./03_subagents.md)** (Weeks 4-6, parallel, 14.5-21 hours) ✅ Plugin-Ready
   - *Why parallel:* Independent of Skills, builds on Memory foundation
   - *Impact:* 40-60% token savings for complex isolated tasks
   - *Use cases:* Deep physics analysis, DataFrame refactoring
   - *Stopping Conditions:* Approval gates (>500 token operations), 50K token budget per subagent
   - *Timeout Handling:* 10-25 min per subagent, warning at 75%/90%
   - *Plugin:* Package in `plugin-name/agents/`

**Decision Gate 2: Proceed to Phase 2?**
- ✅ **PROCEED if:** ≥40% automation rate AND team satisfaction with workflow
- ⚠️ **PAUSE if:** 20-40% automation (adjust skill triggers, refine prompts)
- ❌ **STOP if:** <20% automation OR skills triggering incorrectly (revert to Phase 0 only)

---

### Phase 2: Safety & Distribution (CONDITIONAL)
**Priority: MEDIUM - Only if Phase 1 automation proves stable**

**Goal:** Add workflow guardrails and enable team distribution.

5. **[Enhanced Hooks](./04_enhanced_hooks.md)** (Week 7, 5.5-8.5 hours) ⚠️ Partially Plugin-Ready
   - *Why now:* Builds on Skills (logs activations) and Subagents (captures reports)
   - *Impact:* 100% automated activity tracking
   - *New events:* Notification, SubagentStop, SessionEnd
   - *Graceful Degradation:* Hook failures NEVER block main workflow
   - *Error Rate Monitoring:* Target <5% hook failure rate
   - *Plugin:* Package `hooks.json` config, scripts may need local install

6. **[Checkpointing](./05_checkpointing.md)** (Week 7, parallel, 3-4.5 hours) ❌ Not Plugin-Related
   - *Why parallel:* Already works automatically, just needs documentation
   - *Impact:* Safety net for experiments, minimal setup
   - *Benefit:* Fearless refactoring with Subagents, zero rollback friction
   - *Approval Gate Integration:* Automatic checkpoint before expensive operations
   - *Note:* Core Claude Code feature, document usage only

7. **[Plugin Packaging](./08_plugin_packaging.md)** (Week 8, 8-12 hours) 🎁 Enables Distribution
   - *Why last in phase:* Package validated features for team distribution
   - *Effort:* Plugin scaffold + marketplace setup
   - *Deliverables:* Plugin directory structure, plugin.json manifest, local marketplace
   - *Enables:* Single-command installation for team
   - *Version Control:* Semantic versioning, rollback strategy, dependency management

**Decision Gate 3: Proceed to Phase 3?**
- ✅ **PROCEED if:** User feedback indicates Explanatory style insufficient
- ⚠️ **SKIP (RECOMMENDED):** Current Explanatory style is likely satisfactory
- ❌ **STOP if:** Team satisfied with current output style (most likely outcome)

---

### Phase 3: Optimization (OPTIONAL)
**Priority: LOW - Only if demonstrably beneficial**

**Goal:** Custom behavior refinement (rarely needed).

8. **[Output Styles](./06_output_styles.md)** (Week 9+, 2.5-3.5 hours) ❌ Not Plugin-Packageable
   - *Why optional:* Refinement of existing Explanatory style, not critical
   - *Impact:* Domain-specific physics-focused behavior
   - *Trigger Condition:* Only if user feedback shows need for more physics emphasis
   - *Anthropic Principle:* Start with simple prompt customization, add custom styles only when needed
   - *Note:* Local configuration (`.claude/output-styles/`), not distributable

**Decision Gate 4: Was it worth it?**
- ✅ **SUCCESS if:** Measurable improvement in physics-specific interactions
- ⚠️ **NEUTRAL if:** No noticeable difference (revert, use standard Explanatory style)
- ❌ **FAILURE if:** Degraded experience (immediate revert)

*Key deliverables:* 9 memory files (physics-constants, dataframe-patterns, testing-templates, etc.), refactored CLAUDE.md with imports

*See also:* [Skills](#2-skills-system) (reference memory), [Slash Commands](#7-slash-commands) (use memory in templates)

---

### 2. [Skills System](./02_skills_system.md)
**Model-invoked capabilities with automatic activation**

Claude autonomously activates skills based on context matching. Unlike Slash Commands (manual) or Hooks (event-based), Skills provide intelligent automatic delegation.

*Key deliverables:* 4 skills (physics-validator, multiindex-architect, test-generator, plan-executor)

*See also:* [Slash Commands](#7-slash-commands) (complementary manual control), [Memory](#1-memory-hierarchy) (skills reference memory)

---

### 3. [Subagents](./03_subagents.md)
**Independent context windows for complex isolated tasks**

Specialized AI assistants with separate context windows and custom system prompts. Better than Task agents for exploratory or context-heavy work that shouldn't pollute main conversation.

*Key deliverables:* 4 subagents (physics-validator, dataframe-architect, plotting-engineer, fit-function-specialist)

*See also:* [Skills](#2-skills-system) (automatic routine tasks), [Enhanced Hooks](#4-enhanced-hooks) (SubagentStop event)

---

### 4. [Enhanced Hooks](./04_enhanced_hooks.md)
**3 additional event types for workflow automation**

Extends current 6-event hook system with Notification (activity logging), SubagentStop (completion tracking), and SessionEnd (archival). Enables comprehensive automation monitoring.

*Key deliverables:* 3 new hook scripts (activity-logger, subagent-report, session-archival), settings.json updates

*See also:* [Skills](#2-skills-system) (log activations), [Subagents](#3-subagents) (capture reports)

---

### 5. [Checkpointing](./05_checkpointing.md)
**Automatic edit tracking for safe experimentation**

Out-of-the-box feature capturing code state before each edit. Provides "local undo" independent of git, enabling fearless refactoring and approach comparison.

*Key deliverables:* Usage documentation, workflow integration patterns, optional checkpoint-validator hook

*See also:* [Subagents](#3-subagents) (safe rollback for agent edits), Git workflow (complement, not replacement)

---

### 6. [Output Styles](./06_output_styles.md)
**Custom physics-focused behavior customization**

Modifies Claude Code's system prompt to emphasize scientific correctness, SI units, and domain expertise. Complements current Explanatory style with SolarWindPy-specific focus.

*Key deliverables:* physics-focused.md custom output style

*See also:* [Memory](#1-memory-hierarchy) (style references memory), [Skills](#2-skills-system) (style emphasizes skill usage)

---

### 7. [Slash Commands](./07_slash_commands.md)
**User-invoked workflow shortcuts for explicit control**

Manual prompt shortcuts (e.g., `/coverage`, `/physics`, `/plan-create`) for frequently-repeated workflows where you want deterministic triggering, not automatic activation.

*Key deliverables:* 10 commands across 5 categories (Testing, Review, Planning, Git Workflow)

*See also:* [Skills](#2-skills-system) (complementary automatic activation), [Memory](#1-memory-hierarchy) (commands reference memory)

---

### 8. [Plugin Packaging](./08_plugin_packaging.md)
**Official Anthropic plugin system for distribution and sharing**

Packages slash commands, skills, agents, and hooks into distributable plugins with marketplace support. Enables single-command installation and team/community sharing.

*Key deliverables:* solarwindpy-devtools plugin, plugin.json manifest, marketplace infrastructure

*See also:* All plugin-ready features ([Slash Commands](#7-slash-commands), [Skills](#2-skills-system), [Subagents](#3-subagents), [Hooks](#4-enhanced-hooks))

└── Checkpointing allows safe experimentation
```

### Pattern 2: Test Coverage Workflow
```
Continuous Development:
