## Executive Summary

Slash commands are **user-invoked prompt shortcuts** that complement the automatic Skills system. While Skills activate automatically based on context, slash commands provide **explicit control** for frequently-repeated workflows where you want deterministic triggering.

### Quick Comparison: Slash Commands vs Skills

| Aspect | Slash Commands | Skills |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Invocation** | Manual (`/command`) | Automatic (context-based) |
| **Control** | Explicit, deterministic | Probabilistic (85%+ accuracy) |
| **Complexity** | Single markdown file | Multi-file with scripts/templates |
| **Use Case** | Frequent manual workflows | Automatic workflow integration |
| **Best For** | "I want to run this NOW" | "Claude should detect when to do this" |

### Relevance to SolarWindPy

‚úÖ **HIGHLY RELEVANT** for:
- Frequently-repeated physics validation checks you want to trigger manually
- Quick access to testing workflows (coverage, physics-specific tests)
- Plan creation workflows (explicit invocation preferred over automatic)
- Code review checklists (run on-demand, not automatically)
- Git workflow helpers (branch creation, commit message templates)

---

## Feature Overview

### What Slash Commands Are

User-invoked prompt shortcuts stored as markdown files in `.claude/commands/` (project) or `~/.claude/commands/` (personal). When you type `/command-name`, Claude expands the content as if you typed it manually.

### Core Capabilities

- **Arguments:** `$ARGUMENTS` (all), `$1`, `$2` (positional)
- **Bash execution:** Prefix with `!` to run shell commands
- **File references:** `@path/to/file` includes file contents
- **Frontmatter metadata:** `description`, `allowed-tools`, `model`, character budget
- **Three storage tiers:** Project (`.claude/commands/`), Personal (`~/.claude/commands/`), Plugin-based

### Technical Constraints

- Filename becomes command name (`.claude/commands/review.md` ‚Üí `/review`)
- Supports YAML frontmatter (optional)
- Can execute bash commands with `!` prefix
- SlashCommand tool allows Claude to invoke programmatically

### Current SolarWindPy Usage

‚ùå **No slash commands defined yet** - Opportunity to add high-value commands

## Value Proposition

### Pain Points Addressed

‚úÖ **Repetitive Task Automation (HIGH IMPACT)**
*Current state:* Manually typing long prompts for common workflows (coverage check, physics validation, plan creation)
*With Slash Commands:* `/coverage`, `/physics`, `/plan` trigger full workflows
*Time savings:* 2-5 minutes per invocation √ó 10-20 times/week = **20-100 min/week**

‚úÖ **Plan Execution Efficiency (MEDIUM-HIGH IMPACT)**
*Current state:* Manual GitHub Issues plan creation with long script paths
*With Slash Commands:* `/plan-create`, `/plan-phases`, `/plan-status` for instant access
*Improvement:* Zero cognitive overhead for planning workflow

‚úÖ **Context Preservation (MEDIUM IMPACT)**
*Current state:* Repeated explanations of testing requirements, review criteria
*With Slash Commands:* Standardized templates ensure consistency
*Benefit:* Consistent quality, no forgotten checklist items

‚úÖ **Agent Coordination (LOW-MEDIUM IMPACT)**
*Current state:* Manually crafting agent invocation prompts
*With Slash Commands:* Pre-defined agent workflows (`/validate-physics`, `/optimize-dataframes`)
*Improvement:* Faster, more accurate agent delegation

### Productivity Improvements

- **Instant access** to common workflows (no typing, no memory recall)
- **Consistency** through standardized templates
- **Reduced errors** (checklists ensure completeness)
- **Faster onboarding** (team members discover commands via `/help`)

### Research Workflow Enhancements

- Quick physics validation checks during development
- Standardized code review process
- Consistent testing procedures
- Streamlined plan management

---

## Integration Strategy

### Architecture Fit

Slash commands complement existing SolarWindPy infrastructure:

```
Automation Continuum:

Manual Workflow
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Type full prompt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üÜï Slash Command (/command) ‚Üê Explicit user trigger
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Skill (auto-activates) ‚Üê Claude detects context
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Hook (event-based) ‚Üê Automatic on tool use

Decision Matrix:
- Want explicit control? ‚Üí Slash Command
- Want automatic activation? ‚Üí Skill
- Trigger on events? ‚Üí Hook
```

### Relationship to Existing Systems

| System Component | Integration Approach |
|------------------|---------------------|
| **Skills** | Commands for explicit control; Skills for automatic |
| **Agents** | Commands can invoke specific agents (e.g., `/validate-physics` ‚Üí PhysicsValidator) |
| **Hooks** | Commands can trigger hook-checked workflows |
| **Scripts** | Commands can execute `.claude/scripts/*.sh` with bash prefix |
| **Memory** | Commands reference memory files via `@.claude/memory/...` |
| **GitHub Issues** | Commands streamline plan creation workflow |

### When to Use Slash Commands vs Skills

**Use Slash Command when:**
- ‚úÖ You want **explicit control** over when it runs
- ‚úÖ It's a **frequent manual workflow** (run 5+ times/week)
- ‚úÖ You need **immediate invocation** (not context-dependent)
- ‚úÖ It's a **team-shared template** everyone should use

**Use Skill when:**
- ‚úÖ Claude should **automatically detect** when to activate
- ‚úÖ It's part of **continuous workflow** (not discrete manual task)
- ‚úÖ Requires **multi-file organization** (scripts, templates)
- ‚úÖ Activation accuracy is more important than explicit control

**Examples:**
- `/coverage` (Slash Command - manual check on-demand)
- `physics-validator` (Skill - auto-activates during calculations)
- `/review` (Slash Command - explicit code review request)
- `test-generator` (Skill - auto-activates when coverage drops)

### Backward Compatibility

‚úÖ **Fully compatible** - Slash commands are additive
‚úÖ **No migration needed** - Start with zero, add incrementally
‚úÖ **Coexists with everything** - Skills, hooks, agents unchanged

## Testing Strategy

### Validation Approach

#### Test 1: Command Invocation
```
Scenario: Type /coverage in Claude Code
Expected: Command expands and executes coverage check
Validation: Coverage report displayed
```

#### Test 2: Argument Passing
```
Scenario: /physics solarwindpy/core/ion.py
Expected: Physics validation runs on specified file
Validation: Validation report for ion.py only
```

#### Test 3: Bash Execution
```
Scenario: /plan-status
Expected: gh-plan-status.sh executes
Validation: Plan status output displayed
```

#### Test 4: File References
```
Scenario: /review (which references memory files)
Expected: Memory files loaded and checklist expanded
Validation: Full review checklist appears
```

#### Test 5: Team Consistency
```
Scenario: Multiple team members use /commit
Expected: Consistent commit message format
Validation: All commits follow conventional commits + Claude footer
```

### Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ All 10 commands execute correctly
- ‚úÖ Arguments pass to scripts/prompts properly
- ‚úÖ Bash commands execute with `!` prefix
- ‚úÖ File references (`@`) resolve correctly
- ‚úÖ Time savings ‚â•60 minutes/week measured
- ‚úÖ Team adoption ‚â•80% within 2 weeks

### Monitoring

```bash
# Track command usage (if logging added to commands)
# Could add to each command:
# !echo "$(date) - /command-name used" >> .claude/logs/command-usage.log

# Analyze most-used commands
grep -c "/coverage" .claude/logs/command-usage.log
grep -c "/physics" .claude/logs/command-usage.log
```

## Comparison: Slash Commands vs Skills vs Hooks vs Agents

### Decision Matrix

```
Need explicit control over when it runs?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Slash Command
‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Continue...

Should it run automatically based on context?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Skill
‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Continue...

Should it trigger on specific tool/event?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Hook
‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Continue...

Complex multi-step analysis needed?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Agent/Subagent
‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Manual prompt
```

### Example Mapping for Common Tasks

| Task | Best Solution | Rationale |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| "Check coverage now" | `/coverage` | Explicit on-demand check |
| Auto-detect coverage gaps | `test-generator` skill | Automatic when coverage drops |
| Test after every edit | PostToolUse hook | Event-based automatic |
| Deep physics refactoring | PhysicsValidator subagent | Complex isolated analysis |
| Quick physics check | `/physics` | Explicit validation request |
| Physics validation during edits | PreToolUse hook | Automatic prevention |
| Create GitHub plan | `/plan-create` | Explicit planning action |
| Suggest planning | `plan-executor` skill | Automatic context detection |

## Appendix: Quick Reference

### Creating Slash Commands

```bash
# Create project-level command (shared with team)
mkdir -p .claude/commands
cat > .claude/commands/mycommand.md <<'EOF'
---
description: Short description of what this command does
---

Command instructions here.
Can use $ARGUMENTS, $1, $2 for arguments.
Can use @path/to/file to include files.
Can use !bash commands to execute shell commands.
EOF

# Now invoke with: /mycommand
```

### Command Syntax Reference

## Next Steps

1. **Review Proposed Commands** - Decide which 10 commands to implement
2. **Prioritize** - Start with testing + planning commands (highest frequency)
3. **Create Commands** - Follow implementation specification above
4. **Test** - Validate each command works as expected
5. **Document** - Add to team documentation
6. **Iterate** - Refine based on usage, add custom commands

**Ready to implement?** Start with Phase 1 (6 commands, 3-4 hours) for immediate 30-60 min/week savings.
