# Session Context Compaction - Temporary Storage

## CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
**This compaction file is saved outside solarwindpy/plans/ directory to prevent modification during implementation, which would introduce significant errors.**

## Compacted Session Context

### Current Implementation Status
- **Plan**: single-ecosystem-plan-implementation.tmp.md (saved in root)
- **Session State**: Updated with new priority (single ecosystem implementation)
- **Next Steps**: Git checkpoint â†’ implement plan
- **Safety Protocol**: All working files saved outside plans/ directory

### Key Implementation Context
- **Objective**: Unified plan management system with format specialization
- **Token Savings**: 1,000+ tokens through agent optimization
- **Duration**: 9 hours across 6 phases
- **Safety**: Plan location prevents circular modification errors

### Essential State Information
- Fitfunctions testing completed (95.3% success rate)
- All infrastructure ready for ecosystem implementation
- Git checkpoint required before major structural changes
- Session optimized for extended implementation work

### Implementation Readiness
- Plan preserved in root directory
- Session state updated and documented
- Context compacted for optimal performance
- Ready for immediate execution

**Status**: Context successfully compacted and preserved for implementation session
